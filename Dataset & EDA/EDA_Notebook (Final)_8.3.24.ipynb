

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This happens for different reasons , but a key element is the vicious cycle between holding strong attitudes on an issue and something called “ selective perception. ” Essentially , the stronger your views are on an issue like Trump ’ s impeachment , the more likely you are to attend more carefully to information that supports your views and to ignore or disregard information that contradicts them . Consuming more belief-consistent information will , in turn , increase your original support or disapproval for impeachment , which just fortifies your attitudes . So , no , not much change will be seen in the minds of the 33 percent .\\nExcept , maybe . One of the more interesting findings from research on attitude change is that our more important , self-defining attitudes do not seem to change incrementally , a little at a time , but they can change dramatically , from one extreme to another . Typically , when others try to change our views on important issues that we hold firmly , their attempts to persuade us with facts and figures end up bolstering our original attitudes or pushing us out to even further extremes . But strong attitudes can experience what psychologists call “ threshold-effect changes. ” Over time , when we are exposed to information contradicting our attitudes , that information—even if we ignore , discount or deny it—can seep into our thinking and accumulate to a point where , across some threshold , people radically change their views to the opposite side of the spectrum . In other words , nothing much changes until everything changes .\\nThese jumps from one extreme attitude to another on self-defining issues are not uncommon , and have been seen with former skinheads turned tolerance trainers , peace activists turned violent militants , and religious zealots turned atheists . This type of drastic transformation is , of course , hard to predict , and it can be triggered by seemingly insignificant events ( the tipping point for one skinhead was when his black co-worker tossed him half of his submarine sandwich when he had no lunch ) . But it typically occurs after repeated exposure to information contradicting their attitudes .\\nSo , yes , it is possible that if some of the testimonies in the hearings are experienced by true believers ( at either extreme ) as counter to their beliefs but also persuasive , this information can plant seeds of a different point of view , that might , someday , lead to a big change . Still , this is unlikely to happen very soon .\\nMinds , however , can change among the vast majority of people who don ’ t hold extreme views . A recent study by the nonpartisan group More in Common found that about 67 percent of moderate Americans on both sides of the political divide—a group the authors of the study call “ the exhausted majority ” —are fed up with our current dysfunction , despise the contemptuous state of polarization we are in , and are eager to find ways to talk , compromise and work together again . These folks , particularly the 26 percent of moderates who are politically disengaged and thus are much less identified with either tribe , can be swayed . Of course , this assumes that they are not so burned out by the vitriol of our politics that they are unwilling to devote some attention to information coming out of the hearings .\\nResearch suggests a few basic strategies for changing minds that are , well , changeable . First , immediately establishing the credibility of the witnesses—to both progressives and conservatives —is paramount . For example , the introductions of the witnesses should emphasize their merits for both the left and the right to see . Second , logic and evidence can matter when they are clearly laid out , compelling and derived from trusted sources . Third , moving testimony by witnesses about the profound moral dilemmas they faced in coming forward , and any specific threats they experienced to their and their family ’ s physical safety , can help to humanize otherwise dry , technical testimony and move the listener . And finally , because most viewers tend to lean either red or blue ( even though they are “ exhausted ” ) and so will view the proceedings to some degree through their team ’ s lens , it is critical for the lawmakers to choose to emphasize just a few takeaway points , and then to stress the urgency and importance of the viewers ’ attention to them . This can serve to move viewers from their more automatic , heuristic modes of cognitive processing to more intentional , systematic modes , where they will be more likely to take in new information and learn .\\nBut here is a caution for our leaders in Congress on both sides . Clearly , by many accounts , America is more polarized , anxious and exhausted by our political climate today than ever before . No , this is not all Congress ’ doing , but many in Washington are playing their part . The resulting rise in the toxicity of our culture is such that today 86 percent of Americans are seriously concerned that our divisions will soon lead to violence .\\nSo , as our Republican and Democratic members of Congress prepare for the public hearings—ready themselves to make their case and score points and change minds—they should understand what is at stake . A narrow focus on short wins today can bring devastating outcomes tomorrow . Of course , members of Congress have a job to do to reveal the truth and share the facts with the American public . But our social fabric is stretched to the limit , and the future of our society , in the form of our basic capacities for compassion , connection and shared humanity across our divide , is on the line . The impeachment hearings ’ primary audience—the 67 percent ( not base voters ) —is persuadable through credibility , logic and evidence . This is a chance for lawmakers to plant seeds for changing minds in the future . So , please , for our nation ’ s sake , rise to your best selves .\\nAs someone who knew something about divisions once wrote , “ We are not enemies , but friends . We must not be enemies . Though passion may have strained , it must not break our bonds of affection . The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature. ” Come Wednesday , lawmakers will need to find a way to make their public case effectively , while not inflaming our already heightened sense of contempt and enmity for the other side . In the long run , this is all that will matter .   \n",

Share Tweet Post Email\\nU.S. President Donald Trump is pushing his trade conflict with China toward a point where neither side can back down .\\nBy Aug. 30 , as the U.S. nears mid-term elections vital for Trump ’ s legislative agenda , the White House will be ready to impose 10 percent tariffs on $ 200 billion of Chinese-made products , ranging from clothing to television parts to refrigerators . The levies announced Tuesday -- together with some $ 50 billion already in the works -- stand to raise import prices on almost half of everything the U.S. buys from the Asian nation .\\nChina has seven weeks to make a deal or dig in and try to outlast the U.S. leader . President Xi Jinping , facing his own political pressures to look tough , has vowed to respond blow-for-blow . He ’ s already imposed retaliatory duties targeting Trump ’ s base including Iowa soybeans and Kentucky bourbon .\\nYet matching the latest U.S. barrage would force China to either levy much higher tariffs or take more disruptive steps like canceling purchase orders , encouraging consumer boycotts and putting up regulatory hurdles . Not only does that risk provoking Trump to follow through on threats to tax virtually all Chinese products , it could unleash nationalist sentiment on both sides that fuels a deeper struggle for geopolitical dominance .\\nTrump on Wednesday framed his trade actions as necessary to shield American businesses and farmers from harmful trading practices .\\n“ Other countries ’ trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses . I will open things up , better than ever before , but it can ’ t go too quickly , ” Trump said in a Twitter post from Brussels , where he ’ s attending a NATO summit . “ I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers , and will win ! ”\\n“ It ’ s already past the point of no return , ” said Pauline Loong , managing director at research firm Asia-Analytica in Hong Kong . “ What ’ s next is not so much a trade war or even a cold war as the dawn of an ice age in relations between China and the United States . ”\\nRead more on the escalating conflict Handbags and Cameras Hit as Trump Tariffs Target Consumers\\nYou Have a Month to Comment on Bull Semen , Vegetable Hair Tariff\\nTrump Must Meet Xi to Stop Trade War , Top House Republican Says\\nThose Cheap Chinese TVs ? They May Just Get a Lot More Expensive\\nStocks fell and commodities slid with emerging-market assets Wednesday as investors assessed the fallout . The S & P 500 Index ended the longest rally in a month and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated . While earlier tariffs were expected to have only a limited impact , economists warn a full-blown trade war could derail the strongest economic upswing in years .\\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry said Tuesday that it would be forced to retaliate against what it called “ totally unacceptable ” U.S. tariffs . There have been no confirmed high-level talks between the two sides since an early June visit to Beijing by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that achieved no breakthroughs .\\nBeijing “ never yields to threat or blackmail ” and will retaliate against the “ groundless ” tariffs , China ’ s Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said in written comments to ███ . “ The U.S. side ignored the progress , adopted unilateral and protectionist measures , and started the trade war . ”\\nWhat Our Economists Say ... “ As the targeted imports broaden to include more consumer products , a hit to household wallets and a bump to inflation could start to shift the political calculus in the U.S. , ” said ███ ’ s China economist Fielding Chen .\\nThe Aug. 30 date ensures the trade fight features prominently in November ’ s U.S. congressional elections , and the announcement exposed fissures between Trump and his Republican Party about the strategy . House Ways and Means Committee chief Kevin Brady , of Texas , warned of “ a long , multi-year trade war between the two largest economies in the world that engulfs more and more of the globe . ”\\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch , of Utah , called the new levies “ reckless ” and not “ targeted. ” Senator Chuck Grassley , a Republican from Iowa , said he had a “ great deal of concern ” about the trade spat with China and the level of uncertainty it ’ s creating among farmers and businesses in his state. “ When you don ’ t know what ’ s going to be the outcome , it ’ s very uncertain , and it ’ s had a definite impact , ” he told ███ Television . “ How long is this going to go on ? I hope we can settle pretty soon . ”\\nRead more : Some tariffs apply to flows that don ’ t exist\\nThe latest move suggests that Trump -- who in March declared that “ trade wars are good and easy to win ” -- may be compromising on his pledge to spare consumers from the pain . The tariffs could raise the prices of everything from baseball gloves to handbags to digital cameras just as voters are heading to the polls . Other high-profile items such as mobile phones have so far been spared .\\nThe U.S. felt it had no choice , but to move forward on the new tariffs after China failed to respond to the administration ’ s concerns over unfair trade practices and Beijing ’ s abuse of American intellectual property , according to two senior officials who spoke to reporters . The Trump administration has so far rejected Chinese offers to trim its massive trade surplus by buying more American goods , and is demanding more systemic change .\\n“ For over a year , the Trump administration has patiently urged China to stop its unfair practices , open its market , and engage in true market competition , ” Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement . “ China has not changed its behavior -- behavior that puts the future of the U.S. economy at risk . ”\\nAlthough the looming elections provide an immediate concern for Trump , a trade war poses a more existential concern for Xi , whose Communist Party has built its legitimacy on economic success . Prominent academics and some government officials have begun to question if China ’ s slowing , trade-dependent economy can withstand a sustained attack from Trump , which has already weighed heavily on stock prices .\\nAmong other things , the U.S. is asking China to roll back its “ Made-in-China 2025 ” program , a signature Xi initiative to dominate several strategic industries , such as semiconductors to aerospace development . Since abolishing presidential term limits , Xi has strengthened his control over the levers of power and money in China and can ’ t afford to look weak .\\n“ China is showing no signs of backing down and instead looks like it is preparing for a drawn out conflict , ” said Scott Kennedy , deputy director of China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . “ China has a million and one ways to retaliate . ”\\n— With assistance by Jenny Leonard , Andrew Mayeda , Bryce Baschuk , and Kevin Cirilli   \n",



The Pentagon ’ s top general said Tuesday that the failed special forces mission to rescue James Foley and other hostages being kept by Islamic State militants was the toughest he ’ s ever seen .\\nGen. Martin E. Dempsey , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , didn ’ t go into details , but said the effort expended should answer some of the criticisms raised that the U.S. government didn ’ t do enough to try to get hostages released .\\n“ That was the most complex , highest-risk mission we ’ ve ever taken , ” the Army general said .\\nFoley , a reporter captured in 2012 , was beheaded by an Islamic State terrorist in a brutal execution the militants filmed and released on the Internet on Aug. 19 .\\nFoley ’ s parents have complained that the U.S. government didn ’ t communicate with them about steps that were being taken to try to free him , and said they were told they could be prosecuted if they tried to pay a ransom .\\nWhile Gen. Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel wouldn ’ t go into details of the rescue mission , they said it showed they were trying to do something .\\n“ We have some limitations in our ability to collect intelligence inside Syria , but when we had the opportunity to do so , we tried to get ‘ em , ” Gen. Dempsey said .\\nMr. Hagel said that while there are boundaries to what the U.S. can do , including a strict policy that the country does not pay ransoms , officials could do a better job of “ dealing with families and the human part of this . ”\\nDuring the mission , which reportedly took place earlier in the summer , special operations forces slipped into Syria but were unable to locate Foley or other hostages , who had apparently been moved in the time since the last intelligence the U.S. had .\\nSome military officials have reportedly second-guessed President Obama ’ s decision-making , with one report saying that his hesitation to give the go-ahead reduced the chances for success .\\nThe White House , though , said Mr. Obama gave the go-ahead as soon as they believed the mission could be carried out successfully .\\nIslamic State militants have also killed American journalist Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines . But another American reporter , Peter Theo Curtis , was released late last month , apparently by the Nusra Front , an al Qaeda-linked group .   \n",
            "3  A full week after the alleged “ shellacking “ of President Obama and the Democrats , the country remains a “ stucknation ” locked in a partisan standoff where both factions hold each other in contempt and have a long list of past grievances they want to relitigate .\\nFor several years now , the two parties have so amped up the partisan rhetoric that what used to be middle ground is nothing but scorched earth . It 's a machine fueled by animus , but raises hundreds of millions of dollars for the warring factions and keeps the nation from a necessary reconciliation that 's a prerequisite for moving forward .\\nListening to this cacophony that passes for political discourse , an alien from outer space would come to the conclusion that Americans really can ’ t stand each other and just don ’ t want to defeat their opponents but annihilate them .\\nHistory is never shaped by one thing , but a confluence of trends and events . We have a president who just can ’ t figure out why everybody is not as smart as he is , and a disloyal opposition that so lusts for his demise they would shut down the government to make a rhetorical point .\\nFor many Democratic partisans , the reactionary right is waging a war on women ’ s reproductive rights and working around the clock to strip the right to vote from people of color . A key core belief of many Tea Party Republicans is that Democrats can only win elections if they steal them .\\nThis delegitimizing of the nation ’ s political process popped up for Democrats in Gore v. Bush in 2000 and now has captured conservatives , who pretty much refute the results of every election except for the ones they win . ( A notable exception was Ed Gillespie ’ s concession to Sen. Mark Warner , which went some distance in restoring the notion of a Virginian gentleman . )\\nJust spend an hour listening to national talk show host Michael Savage and his many less talented imitators that blanket the airwaves . You will hear such a deep hatred for the president you ’ ll understand that Savage and his crowd just don ’ t have contempt for the president -- but for the tens of millions of their fellow Americans that voted for him twice .\\nEven as ISIS does its thing Savage has described the sitting president as the “ enemy within ” who wants to spread Ebola , open the door to “ illegals , ” all so as to make the U.S. a third-world nation in a kind of egalitarian “ marxist ” exercise aimed at collapsing capitalism . These statements are made despite the president ’ s record deportations and unprecedented profits enjoyed by U.S. corporations during the president ’ s tenure . A mediocre chief executive he may be , but he certainly is not a marxist .\\nWhile largely ignored by the mainstream media , Savage ’ s millions of loyal listeners are also voracious readers who sent his recently released “ Stop the Coming Civil War : My Savage Truth ” on to the Barnes and Nobles big seller list . The bookseller ’ s website says Savage tells his readers “ our nation is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown . ”\\nThis near violent alienation extends into the global warming debate with one side insisting that as long as there is a God we need not worry about environmental consequences and we must burn as much fossil fuel as possible to fire up prosperity for future generations . Their opponents see these “ climate change deniers ” as a clear and present danger to the planet , funded by fossil fuel profiteers , whose only reason for existing is accumulating as much material wealth as possible so as to extend their dominion over a quickly dying planet .\\nThere is just no reconciling these alienated factions . Billions of dollars are backing up both narratives , even as the homeless stretch out in the street and West Africa begs for the basics . No wonder most Americans decided to sit out Choice 2014 .\\nIn the aftermath of the 2014 midterms , the milquetoast political press offers a ho-hum narrative dominated by the politicians ' personal story . What ’ s President Obama ’ s legacy ? Which Republican will claim the 2016 nomination ? How do the results of 2014 impact former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s chances to win the presidency ?\\nRank them . Sort them . Do whatever your cyberalgorithms tell you will get the most eyeballs . The political reporting is so fixated on who 's winning or falling behind that the horse race eclipses the actual economic and social conditions of the country . What they seem to be missing is just how badly polarized the nation is and just how many American households are still falling behind .\\nAs for the voters ' hearts and minds , they get their shot during the exit polls . Based on those polls Republicans would be mistaken to interpret their victory as some kind of blank check . As the New York Times reported , voters surveyed this time around were skeptical of both parties . They believed the U.S. economy is rigged for the 1 percent and are doubtful their children will do better than they have .\\nThere is something that is ruminating out there beyond the Beltway and the safe green zone of the corporate media that acts as its buffer . Looking at the “ right way-wrong way ” survey data by the NBC News/Wall Street Journal it has pretty much been all downhill from right after the Sept. 11 attack . That was when just over 70 percent of those surveyed thought the nation was headed in the right direction as ground zero still smoldered , the nation pulled together and the world embraced us as a victim of terrorism .\\nBy this summer , more than 12 years into our global war on terror , and a few years into the “ recovery , ” that same poll was totally upside down with 70 percent now saying the nation was headed in the wrong direction . In the immediate run-up to the midterms the president said U.S. intelligence missed the rise of ISIS , the Secret Service left the front door of the White House and the Centers for Disease Control fumbled the initial response of Ebola .\\nMost all the Democrats ran away from the president . Consistently the president was a couple of beats behind the breaking news where his handlers must have thought it was safe . Whether it was responding to the wave of undocumented children crossing the border , ISIS or Ebola the White House waited for events to play out for weeks and even months , and only when the media declared a “ crisis , ” would we get presidential action . It was as if President Obama ’ s heart wasn ’ t in doing his job .\\nOff course for the Savage contingent this passiveness was extrapolated as premeditation and diabolical planning to collapse the nation into an oozing morass of disease and lawless chaos .\\nThe president ’ s poor performance , whatever the reason for it , had consequences down ballot . Republicans not only won the U.S. Senate but they now hold 31 of the nation ’ s governorships , replacing Democrats in Arkansas , Illinois , Massachusetts and Maryland . The GOP now has total control , that is the governorship and the state legislatures , in 21 states compared to the Democrats who now have a third of that many .\\nIn the state races there were no doubt local issues also in play . Yet New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , who led the Republican Governors Association 's bid to capture as many state capitals as possible , says in the 35 states he visited voters expressed major anxiety about the president ’ s lack of leadership . “ I wouldn ’ t call it fear . I ’ d call it anxiety , really anxious . I think the best way to describe it was a woman I met who told me she was in her 80s from Vero Beach and she said to me , 'Governor what 's happened to our country ? We used to control events , now events control us . ' ”\\n“ I think the reason folks are anxious is they feel like the president is weak and as a result our country is perceived to be weak , ” Christie told reporters after he voted . “ I think the country is looking for the president to be strong and I wish he would be . He ’ s my president too. ” Up against Michael Savage Christie sounds like Eisenhower , a throwback to the Republican Party that pledged allegiance to the flag and respected the occupant of the White House , no matter what his party affiliation , because they respected the office and by extension the broader electorate .\\nThis nation ’ s existential crisis started well before President Obama was on the scene , as any graph over the growing wealth disparity will illustrate . What ails us goes deeper than a passive and detached president who 's reliably two beats behind the news wave and a Republican Party leadership committed to derailing his presidency at any cost . Even as the factions continue their war of attrition on each other , the American worker continued to fall behind , thanks to stagnant or declining wages despite increased productivity .\\nThese are the same economic conditions candidate Barack Obama railed against , and before him candidate Bill Clinton . Yet from 1979 until 2013 productivity grew by almost 65 percent but average workers only saw their compensation increase by a measly 8 percent increase in those 33 years . More recently , from 2007 until 2013 the median U.S. income dropped every year and when adjusted for inflation was the lowest since 1995 .\\nAll you need to know about the frame of mind of Americans for the 2014 midterm was in the small print of the latest Department of Labor report on employment that came a couple of days after the election . “ In October , the number of long-term unemployed ( those jobless for 27 weeks or more ) was little changed at 2.9 million , ” writes the Department of Labor , which translates to roughly a third of the unemployed . Civilian labor force participation continued its steady decline , hovering now at 62.8 percent , flat since April .\\nLast month the DOL reported 7 million people were consigned to part-time work , even though they wanted full-time opportunities . Also in October , DOL said 2.2 million people were “ marginally attached to the labor force , ” a disconcerting stat DOL says “ was little changed from a year earlier. ” “ These individuals were not in the labor force ” but “ had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months . They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the four weeks preceding the survey . ”\\nAt the same time that most U.S. households were stuck in neutral or slipping back into reverse , the top 1 percent continued to buzz by in overdrive leaving the rest of the U.S. in their dust . From the first half of 2013 to the first half of 2014 , real hourly wages fell across the board with the exception of states that raised the minimum wage . Meanwhile “ the wealthiest one percent captured 95 percent of the post financial crisis growth since 2009 , while the bottom 90 percent became poorer , ” according to the World Economic Forum ’ s Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 .\\nAnd while the business press chirped out happy faces over the officially declining unemployment number , the rest of the stats in the latest Department of Labor data described the ongoing wasting of a nation through workforce and wage stagnation .\\nAmericans are trying to walk up the downward escalator whose motor is driven by corporate greed and bipartisan complicity . While corporations keep a lid on compensation and hiring they have increasingly become more skilled at stashing hundreds of billions of dollars in profits offshore , shifting their tax burden onto the same population that they have been squeezing for decades .\\nBy some estimates as much as $ 2 trillion remains stashed offshore , kneecapping any real recovery . This creates a phony scarcity to help build back the pressure to get their tax cuts , shrink the federal government , help rescind the social contract and break what ’ s left of the American labor movement .\\nHaving totally captured both political parties it is in the interests of corporations to fund the great American political kabuki dance that perpetuates the myth that on the issues that matter most to the corporations there ’ s a big difference between how both parties would govern . This partisan sideshow keeps the electorate distracted from the widening income disparity , wealth concentration and tax shifting that has happened under the leadership of both political parties for decades .\\nIn 2008 we went for `` hope and change , '' but six years later there 's this sense we are still on a downward trajectory , despite the booming stock market and gas prices dropping so fast experts are worried . Our kids are burdened with billions in debt and now the very same Wall Street vultures that created the mortgage meltdown are coming back to buy up foreclosed homes so they can rent them to the serfs who now can ’ t afford their own castle .\\nIt is this gnawing insecurity about the prospects for our families that is the psychological fallout from the Great Recession and our wars without end . For our grandparents it was shorthanded as the `` Depression era '' mentality . It defined every choice they made but also burnished a sense of national purpose , self-sacrifice and collectivity . It beat fascism on two fronts , came home , had a parade , built the interstate highway system , and sent their soldiers to school for free . But back then we had FDR who united the population against the speculators .\\nToday most people grapple with their economic dislocation in isolation . The TV says we are in a recovery so it must be just me , my family , my household falling behind . Every day the TV says the market is up and yet that seems to have less and less to do with the average American family 's economic well-being .\\nYes , we are a war-prone republic , but we have always had periods when we collectively stood down , albeit briefly . Now we are told we are in a further notice eternal war where peace comes only when we leave this earthly plain . I do n't know if the human psyche is wired for that .\\nBut there is something else at work structurally that the media also shies away from because it undermines our superpower status narrative and the notion of our exceptionalism . Even talking about it one risks looking unpatriotic . For many Americans this has been the linchpin for their sense of well-being in an ever-changing world . We are just not up to coming to grips with the notion that planetary peace , prosperity and stability is truly a multilateral project . Where ’ s the national pride in that ?\\nWhen the president was n't propping up the phony Bush war on terror narrative , he spoke eloquently about this reality as he did at West Point .\\nPresident Obama is presiding in a period where in the scheme of world affairs , save the nuclear war option , the presidency is shrinking . This globally integrated marketplace we were so hell-bent to create has geopolitical consequences .\\nYou can ’ t rely on China to finance your federal debt and not expect to lose leverage in the world . While Republicans like to put the shrinking of the presidency on the current occupant of the White House , it ignores structural things like that and the well-documented choice by U.S. multinationals and hedge funds to bet against America because they can make more money someplace else .\\nIronically , these very hedge fund players that helped fund Christie ’ s Republican Governors Association , like Elliot Management ’ s Paul Singer who gave over a million dollars to the RGA , are the same crowd looking to profit from the inversion deals being cut by U.S. corporations to abandon the U.S. to reduce their U.S. tax liability .\\nSo is it now , `` ask not what your country can do for you '' but which country gives you the highest rate of return ?   \n",

It feeds into this narrative that he 's a bully ''\\nKing : `` If that perception starts to stick in , that 's not a presidential temperament ''\\nTop aides to Gov . Chris Christie communicate about lane closures to George Washington Bridge\\nChristie says he knew nothing about what transpired ; mayor says e-mails raise credibility questions\\nThis is n't the first time critics have called New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie a bully . But now the man many consider a Republican presidential frontrunner is on the defensive , scrambling to distance himself from an erupting political scandal that threatens to tarnish his image well before the 2016 elections .\\nE-mails that surfaced Wednesday suggest top Christie appointees orchestrated traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge as part of a political vendetta to punish a local mayor who would n't support him at the polls . Lane closures around approaches to the country 's busiest bridge snarled traffic for days in September in Fort Lee , New Jersey -- a problem the governor and his administration had originally blamed on a mishandled traffic study .\\nIn response to the e-mail firestorm , Christie said Wednesday that he was misled by staff . He called the conduct outrageous and said he knew nothing about it .\\n`` This behavior is not representative of me or my administration in any way , '' he said , `` and people will be held responsible for their actions . ''\\nEven if he had nothing to do with the traffic snarls , the allegations could have serious consequences for Christie , analysts said .\\nJUST WATCHED Did Christie know about traffic scandal ?

He 's going to have to find some way to defuse this to prove he does n't run a shop like that , '' said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen , a former adviser to several U.S. presidents .\\nIt 's a defining moment for Christie , CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said . And how he deals with the situation in the next two days -- from whether he fires anyone to what he says -- will be key .\\n`` If he handles it decisively and then he sits down and calmly answers questions and does n't berate the reporters who ask them , then he has a chance to be a leader who dealt with a crisis and he moves on , '' King said . `` But if that perception starts to stick in , that 's not a presidential temperament . And that 's bad for him nationally in his perspective . It 's bad for him as he starts his new term in New Jersey . And it 's bad for him with the audience he needs to care about most politically long-term at the moment , and that 's the Republican base that he wants to make him their nominee . ''\\n`` Not necessarily , '' Oxford University historian Timothy Stanley wrote in an opinion piece for CNN.com . `` He 's a resourceful politician and it 's still many months before campaigning starts in earnest . But now his opponents have a stick to beat him with . Best of all , it 's an anti-government stick . If Republicans stand for anything right now , it 's opposing the ability of government to mess with the individual 's life -- and here we have a classic example of politicians taking revenge on each other at the expense of the average citizen . ''\\nPolitical commentators from both sides of the aisle immediately recognized the potential for credibility questions , particularly around Christie 's explanations in recent months about the traffic jams in Fort Lee and previous comments rejecting suggestions of political mischief .\\n`` He 's already cemented a narrative as something of a bully , '' said S.E . Cupp , a Republican political strategist and CNN `` Crossfire '' host . `` If this was happening in his administration , I do n't think it would shocking . ''\\nBut , she said , if it `` turns out he 's lying about what he knew or whether he ordered it -- that 's going to be the worst , the most damaging . Because his authenticity is his calling card . ''\\nIt 's important to ask how much Christie knew , Gergen said , but the reality might be more complicated .\\n`` Sometimes the boss does not order something , '' Gergen said , describing the Nixon White House during the Watergate scandal . `` I do n't know whether Nixon ordered Watergate , but I can guarantee you that people who carried out Watergate thought that 's what he would have wanted . There 's an environment in which you find yourself sometimes on staff when things do n't have to be said . You sort of know . ''\\nThe correspondence , subpoenaed by Democrats investigating the matter and spiced with tough Jersey political talk and expletives , is the most damaging evidence so far supporting their assertions the move was orchestrated because Fort Lee 's mayor , a Democrat , did n't endorse Christie 's re-election .\\nMayor Mark Sokolich said the traffic mess created serious hardships for commuters and other residents , and impacted public safety in his community .\\nThe exchanges began three weeks before access lanes to the bridge were closed , causing heavy traffic backups between September 9 and 13 , two months before Election Day .\\n`` Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee , '' Bridget Anne Kelly , Christie 's deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs , said in an e-mail to David Wildstein , then the highest-level appointee representing the state at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , which operates the bridge connecting the two states .\\nIn another message about school buses with students onboard caught in the traffic jams , Wildstein writes , `` they are the children of Buono voters , '' apparently referring to Barbara Buono , Christie 's Democratic opponent in last November 's gubernatorial election .\\nThose cited in the series of e-mails and text messages did not respond to requests for comment or to verify the communications .\\nWildstein , who has left his job , is expected to appear at a legislative hearing on Thursday .\\nDemocratic New Jersey Assembly Deputy Speaker John Wisniewski said the e-mails call into question the integrity of the governor 's office .\\nChristie , he said , `` has a lot of explaining to do . ''\\n`` I do not believe the governor called the Port Authority and said , 'Close some lanes . ' But I did say I hold him responsible for the atmosphere . Now finding that that atmosphere existed in his own office is what I find really troubling , '' Wisniewski said .\\nJUST WATCHED E-mails tie Christie aides to gridlock Replay More Videos ...

But I 'm beginning to question my judgment , '' Sokolich said .\\nThe mayor raised the issue of public safety being compromised . A letter by his emergency services coordinator , Paul Favia , on September 10 obtained by CNN cited `` new traffic patterns '' around the bridge 's toll plaza that were backing up traffic in Fort Lee .\\n`` This new traffic pattern is causing unnecessary delays for emergency services to arrive on scene for medical emergencies , '' Favia said , citing one case in which paramedics rushing to aid an unconscious elderly woman suffering a heart attack were held up and had to meet the ambulance transporting the victim at the hospital instead of at the scene . She later died .\\nDetails surrounding the woman 's death have n't been released . But the situation could deepen Christie 's political woes , Gergen said .\\n`` If a woman died here , '' Gergen said , `` he 's in deep , deep trouble . ''\\nChristie is now campaigning for fellow GOP governors as chairman of the Republican Governors Association and is seen as prime political target for national Democrats .\\nThey rarely attacked him during his re-election campaign but are now becoming more aggressive with the bridge controversy unfolding .\\n`` These revelations are troubling for any public official , but they also indicate what we 've come to expect from Governor Christie - when people oppose him , he exacts retribution . When people question him , he belittles and snidely jokes . And when anyone dares to look into his administration , he bullies and attacks , '' said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , the Democratic National Committee chair , in a statement .\\nA source close to Christie said `` there will probably be some sacrificial firing and that 'll be it .

                         This happens for different reasons, but a key element is the vicious cycle between holding strong attitudes on an issue and something called “selective perception.” Essentially, the stronger your views are on an issue like Trump’s impeachment, the more likely you are to attend more carefully to information that supports your views and to ignore or disregard information that contradicts them. Consuming more belief-consistent information will, in turn, increase your original support or disapproval for impeachment, which just fortifies your attitudes. So, no, not much change will be seen in the minds of the 33 percent.\\n\\nExcept, maybe. One of the more interesting findings from research on attitude change is that our more important, self-defining attitudes do not seem to change incrementally, a little at a time, but they can change dramatically, from one extreme to another. Typically, when others try to change our views on important issues that we hold firmly, their attempts to persuade us with facts and figures end up bolstering our original attitudes or pushing us out to even further extremes. But strong attitudes can experience what psychologists call “threshold-effect changes.” Over time, when we are exposed to information contradicting our attitudes, that information—even if we ignore, discount or deny it—can seep into our thinking and accumulate to a point where, across some threshold, people radically change their views to the opposite side of the spectrum. In other words, nothing much changes until everything changes.\\n\\nThese jumps from one extreme attitude to another on self-defining issues are not uncommon, and have been seen with former skinheads turned tolerance trainers, peace activists turned violent militants, and religious zealots turned atheists. This type of drastic transformation is, of course, hard to predict, and it can be triggered by seemingly insignificant events (the tipping point for one skinhead was when his black co-worker tossed him half of his submarine sandwich when he had no lunch). But it typically occurs after repeated exposure to information contradicting their attitudes.\\n\\nSo, yes, it is possible that if some of the testimonies in the hearings are experienced by true believers (at either extreme) as counter to their beliefs but also persuasive, this information can plant seeds of a different point of view, that might, someday, lead to a big change. Still, this is unlikely to happen very soon.\\n\\nMinds, however, can change among the vast majority of people who don’t hold extreme views. A recent study by the nonpartisan group More in Common found that about 67 percent of moderate Americans on both sides of the political divide—a group the authors of the study call “the exhausted majority”—are fed up with our current dysfunction, despise the contemptuous state of polarization we are in, and are eager to find ways to talk, compromise and work together again. These folks, particularly the 26 percent of moderates who are politically disengaged and thus are much less identified with either tribe, can be swayed. Of course, this assumes that they are not so burned out by the vitriol of our politics that they are unwilling to devote some attention to information coming out of the hearings.\\n\\nResearch suggests a few basic strategies for changing minds that are, well, changeable. First, immediately establishing the credibility of the witnesses—to both progressives and conservatives —is paramount. For example, the introductions of the witnesses should emphasize their merits for both the left and the right to see. Second, logic and evidence can matter when they are clearly laid out, compelling and derived from trusted sources. Third, moving testimony by witnesses about the profound moral dilemmas they faced in coming forward, and any specific threats they experienced to their and their family’s physical safety, can help to humanize otherwise dry, technical testimony and move the listener. And finally, because most viewers tend to lean either red or blue (even though they are “exhausted”) and so will view the proceedings to some degree through their team’s lens, it is critical for the lawmakers to choose to emphasize just a few takeaway points, and then to stress the urgency and importance of the viewers’ attention to them. This can serve to move viewers from their more automatic, heuristic modes of cognitive processing to more intentional, systematic modes, where they will be more likely to take in new information and learn.\\n\\nBut here is a caution for our leaders in Congress on both sides. Clearly, by many accounts, America is more polarized, anxious and exhausted by our political climate today than ever before. No, this is not all Congress’ doing, but many in Washington are playing their part. The resulting rise in the toxicity of our culture is such that today 86 percent of Americans are seriously concerned that our divisions will soon lead to violence.\\n\\nSo, as our Republican and Democratic members of Congress prepare for the public hearings—ready themselves to make their case and score points and change minds—they should understand what is at stake. A narrow focus on short wins today can bring devastating outcomes tomorrow. Of course, members of Congress have a job to do to reveal the truth and share the facts with the American public. But our social fabric is stretched to the limit, and the future of our society, in the form of our basic capacities for compassion, connection and shared humanity across our divide, is on the line. The impeachment hearings’ primary audience—the 67 percent ( not base voters)—is persuadable through credibility, logic and evidence. This is a chance for lawmakers to plant seeds for changing minds in the future. So, please, for our nation’s sake, rise to your best selves.\\n\\nAs someone who knew something about divisions once wrote, “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.” Come Wednesday, lawmakers will need to find a way to make their public case effectively, while not inflaming our already heightened sense of contempt and enmity for the other side. In the long run, this is all that will matter.   \n",

is pushing his trade conflict with China toward a point where neither side can back down.\\n\\nBy Aug. 30, as the U.S. nears mid-term elections vital for Trump’s legislative agenda, the White House will be ready to impose 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese-made products, ranging from clothing to television parts to refrigerators. The levies announced Tuesday -- together with some $50 billion already in the works -- stand to raise import prices on almost half of everything the U.S. buys from the Asian nation.\\n\\nChina has seven weeks to make a deal or dig in and try to outlast the U.S. leader. President Xi Jinping, facing his own political pressures to look tough, has vowed to respond blow-for-blow. He’s already imposed retaliatory duties targeting Trump’s base including Iowa soybeans and Kentucky bourbon.\\n\\nYet matching the latest U.S. barrage would force China to either levy much higher tariffs or take more disruptive steps like canceling purchase orders, encouraging consumer boycotts and putting up regulatory hurdles. Not only does that risk provoking Trump to follow through on threats to tax virtually all Chinese products, it could unleash nationalist sentiment on both sides that fuels a deeper struggle for geopolitical dominance.\\n\\nTrump on Wednesday framed his trade actions as necessary to shield American businesses and farmers from harmful trading practices.\\n\\n“Other countries’ trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses. I will open things up, better than ever before, but it can’t go too quickly,” Trump said in a Twitter post from Brussels, where he’s attending a NATO summit. “I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win!”\\n\\n“It’s already past the point of no return,” said Pauline Loong, managing director at research firm Asia-Analytica in Hong Kong. “What’s next is not so much a trade war or even a cold war as the dawn of an ice age in relations between China and the United States.”\\n\\nRead more on the escalating conflict Handbags and Cameras Hit as Trump Tariffs Target Consumers\\n\\nYou Have a Month to Comment on Bull Semen, Vegetable Hair Tariff\\n\\nTrump Must Meet Xi to Stop Trade War, Top House Republican Says\\n\\nThose Cheap Chinese TVs? They May Just Get a Lot More Expensive\\n\\nStocks fell and commodities slid with emerging-market assets Wednesday as investors assessed the fallout. The S&P 500 Index ended the longest rally in a month and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated. While earlier tariffs were expected to have only a limited impact, economists warn a full-blown trade war could derail the strongest economic upswing in years.\\n\\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry said Tuesday that it would be forced to retaliate against what it called “ totally unacceptable” U.S. tariffs. There have been no confirmed high-level talks between the two sides since an early June visit to Beijing by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that achieved no breakthroughs.\\n\\nBeijing “never yields to threat or blackmail” and will retaliate against the “groundless” tariffs, China’s Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said in written comments to Bloomberg. “The U.S. side ignored the progress, adopted unilateral and protectionist measures, and started the trade war.”\\n\\nWhat Our Economists Say... “As the targeted imports broaden to include more consumer products, a hit to household wallets and a bump to inflation could start to shift the political calculus in the U.S.,” said Bloomberg’s China economist Fielding Chen.\\n\\nThe Aug. 30 date ensures the trade fight features prominently in November’s U.S. congressional elections, and the announcement exposed fissures between Trump and his Republican Party about the strategy. House Ways and Means Committee chief Kevin Brady, of Texas, warned of “a long, multi-year trade war between the two largest economies in the world that engulfs more and more of the globe.”\\n\\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, of Utah, called the new levies “reckless” and not “targeted.” Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, said he had a “great deal of concern” about the trade spat with China and the level of uncertainty it’s creating among farmers and businesses in his state.“When you don’t know what’s going to be the outcome, it’s very uncertain, and it’s had a definite impact,” he told Bloomberg Television. “How long is this going to go on? I hope we can settle pretty soon.”\\n\\nRead more: Some tariffs apply to flows that don’t exist\\n\\nThe latest move suggests that Trump -- who in March declared that “trade wars are good and easy to win” -- may be compromising on his pledge to spare consumers from the pain. The tariffs could raise the prices of everything from baseball gloves to handbags to digital cameras just as voters are heading to the polls. Other high-profile items such as mobile phones have so far been spared.\\n\\nUnfair Practices\\n\\nThe U.S. felt it had no choice, but to move forward on the new tariffs after China failed to respond to the administration’s concerns over unfair trade practices and Beijing’s abuse of American intellectual property, according to two senior officials who spoke to reporters. The Trump administration has so far rejected Chinese offers to trim its massive trade surplus by buying more American goods, and is demanding more systemic change.\\n\\n“For over a year, the Trump administration has patiently urged China to stop its unfair practices, open its market, and engage in true market competition,” Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement. “China has not changed its behavior -- behavior that puts the future of the U.S. economy at risk.”\\n\\nAlthough the looming elections provide an immediate concern for Trump, a trade war poses a more existential concern for Xi, whose Communist Party has built its legitimacy on economic success. Prominent academics and some government officials have begun to question if China’s slowing, trade-dependent economy can withstand a sustained attack from Trump, which has already weighed heavily on stock prices.\\n\\nAmong other things, the U.S. is asking China to roll back its “Made-in-China 2025” program, a signature Xi initiative to dominate several strategic industries, such as semiconductors to aerospace development. Since abolishing presidential term limits, Xi has strengthened his control over the levers of power and money in China and can’t afford to look weak.\\n\\n“China is showing no signs of backing down and instead looks like it is preparing for a drawn out conflict,” said Scott Kennedy, deputy director of China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “China has a million and one ways to retaliate.”\\n\\n— With assistance by Jenny Leonard, Andrew Mayeda, Bryce Baschuk, and Kevin Cirilli   \n",

general said Tuesday that the failed special forces mission to rescue James Foley and other hostages being kept by Islamic State militants was the toughest he’s ever seen.\\n\\nGen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, didn’t go into details, but said the effort expended should answer some of the criticisms raised that the U.S. government didn’t do enough to try to get hostages released.\\n\\n“That was the most complex, highest-risk mission we’ve ever taken,” the Army general said.\\n\\nFoley, a reporter captured in 2012, was beheaded by an Islamic State terrorist in a brutal execution the militants filmed and released on the Internet on Aug. 19.\\n\\nFoley’s parents have complained that the U.S. government didn’t communicate with them about steps that were being taken to try to free him, and said they were told they could be prosecuted if they tried to pay a ransom.\\n\\nWhile Gen. Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel wouldn’t go into details of the rescue mission, they said it showed they were trying to do something.\\n\\n“We have some limitations in our ability to collect intelligence inside Syria, but when we had the opportunity to do so, we tried to get ‘em,” Gen. Dempsey said.\\n\\nMr. Hagel said that while there are boundaries to what the U.S. can do, including a strict policy that the country does not pay ransoms, officials could do a better job of “dealing with families and the human part of this.”\\n\\nDuring the mission, which reportedly took place earlier in the summer, special operations forces slipped into Syria but were unable to locate Foley or other hostages, who had apparently been moved in the time since the last intelligence the U.S. had.\\n\\nSome military officials have reportedly second-guessed President Obama’s decision-making, with one report saying that his hesitation to give the go-ahead reduced the chances for success.\\n\\nThe White House, though, said Mr. Obama gave the go-ahead as soon as they believed the mission could be carried out successfully.\\n\\nIslamic State militants have also killed American journalist Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines. But another American reporter, Peter Theo Curtis, was released late last month, apparently by the Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-linked group.\\n\\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

            "3  A full week after the alleged “shellacking “ of President Obama and the Democrats, the country remains a “stucknation” locked in a partisan standoff where both factions hold each other in contempt and have a long list of past grievances they want to relitigate.\\n\\nFor several years now, the two parties have so amped up the partisan rhetoric that what used to be middle ground is nothing but scorched earth. It's a machine fueled by animus, but raises hundreds of millions of dollars for the warring factions and keeps the nation from a necessary reconciliation that's a prerequisite for moving forward.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nListening to this cacophony that passes for political discourse, an alien from outer space would come to the conclusion that Americans really can’t stand each other and just don’t want to defeat their opponents but annihilate them.\\n\\nNo wonder Putin sent his armor into the Ukraine.\\n\\nHistory is never shaped by one thing, but a confluence of trends and events. We have a president who just can’t figure out why everybody is not as smart as he is, and a disloyal opposition that so lusts for his demise they would shut down the government to make a rhetorical point.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nFor many Democratic partisans, the reactionary right is waging a war on women’s reproductive rights and working around the clock to strip the right to vote from people of color. A key core belief of many Tea Party Republicans is that Democrats can only win elections if they steal them.\\n\\nThis delegitimizing of the nation’s political process popped up for Democrats in Gore v. Bush in 2000 and now has captured conservatives, who pretty much refute the results of every election except for the ones they win. (A notable exception was Ed Gillespie’s concession to Sen. Mark Warner, which went some distance in restoring the notion of a Virginian gentleman.)\\n\\nJust spend an hour listening to national talk show host Michael Savage and his many less talented imitators that blanket the airwaves. You will hear such a deep hatred for the president you’ll understand that Savage and his crowd just don’t have contempt for the president -- but for the tens of millions of their fellow Americans that voted for him twice.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nEven as ISIS does its thing Savage has described the sitting president as the “enemy within” who wants to spread Ebola, open the door to “illegals,” all so as to make the U.S. a third-world nation in a kind of egalitarian “marxist” exercise aimed at collapsing capitalism. These statements are made despite the president’s record deportations and unprecedented profits enjoyed by U.S. corporations during the president’s tenure. A mediocre chief executive he may be, but he certainly is not a marxist.\\n\\nWhile largely ignored by the mainstream media, Savage’s millions of loyal listeners are also voracious readers who sent his recently released “Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth” on to the Barnes and Nobles big seller list. The bookseller’s website says Savage tells his readers “our nation is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown.”\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nThis near violent alienation extends into the global warming debate with one side insisting that as long as there is a God we need not worry about environmental consequences and we must burn as much fossil fuel as possible to fire up prosperity for future generations. Their opponents see these “climate change deniers” as a clear and present danger to the planet, funded by fossil fuel profiteers, whose only reason for existing is accumulating as much material wealth as possible so as to extend their dominion over a quickly dying planet.\\n\\nThere is just no reconciling these alienated factions. Billions of dollars are backing up both narratives, even as the homeless stretch out in the street and West Africa begs for the basics. No wonder most Americans decided to sit out Choice 2014.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the 2014 midterms, the milquetoast political press offers a ho-hum narrative dominated by the politicians' personal story. What’s President Obama’s legacy? Which Republican will claim the 2016 nomination? How do the results of 2014 impact former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s chances to win the presidency?\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nRank them. Sort them. Do whatever your cyberalgorithms tell you will get the most eyeballs. The political reporting is so fixated on who's winning or falling behind that the horse race eclipses the actual economic and social conditions of the country. What they seem to be missing is just how badly polarized the nation is and just how many American households are still falling behind.\\n\\nAs for the voters' hearts and minds, they get their shot during the exit polls. Based on those polls Republicans would be mistaken to interpret their victory as some kind of blank check. As the New York Times reported, voters surveyed this time around were skeptical of both parties. They believed the U.S. economy is rigged for the 1 percent and are doubtful their children will do better than they have.\\n\\nThere is something that is ruminating out there beyond the Beltway and the safe green zone of the corporate media that acts as its buffer. Looking at the “right way-wrong way” survey data by the NBC News/Wall Street Journal it has pretty much been all downhill from right after the Sept. 11 attack. That was when just over 70 percent of those surveyed thought the nation was headed in the right direction as ground zero still smoldered, the nation pulled together and the world embraced us as a victim of terrorism.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nBy this summer, more than 12 years into our global war on terror, and a few years into the “recovery,” that same poll was totally upside down with 70 percent now saying the nation was headed in the wrong direction. In the immediate run-up to the midterms the president said U.S. intelligence missed the rise of ISIS, the Secret Service left the front door of the White House and the Centers for Disease Control fumbled the initial response of Ebola.\\n\\nMost all the Democrats ran away from the president. Consistently the president was a couple of beats behind the breaking news where his handlers must have thought it was safe. Whether it was responding to the wave of undocumented children crossing the border, ISIS or Ebola the White House waited for events to play out for weeks and even months, and only when the media declared a “crisis,” would we get presidential action. It was as if President Obama’s heart wasn’t in doing his job.\\n\\nOff course for the Savage contingent this passiveness was extrapolated as premeditation and diabolical planning to collapse the nation into an oozing morass of disease and lawless chaos.\\n\\nThe president’s poor performance, whatever the reason for it, had consequences down ballot. Republicans not only won the U.S. Senate but they now hold 31 of the nation’s governorships, replacing Democrats in Arkansas, Illinois, Massachusetts and Maryland. The GOP now has total control, that is the governorship and the state legislatures, in 21 states compared to the Democrats who now have a third of that many.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nIn the state races there were no doubt local issues also in play. Yet New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who led the Republican Governors Association's bid to capture as many state capitals as possible, says in the 35 states he visited voters expressed major anxiety about the president’s lack of leadership. “I wouldn’t call it fear. I’d call it anxiety, really anxious. I think the best way to describe it was a woman I met who told me she was in her 80s from Vero Beach and she said to me, 'Governor what's happened to our country? We used to control events, now events control us.'”\\n\\n“I think the reason folks are anxious is they feel like the president is weak and as a result our country is perceived to be weak,” Christie told reporters after he voted. “I think the country is looking for the president to be strong and I wish he would be. He’s my president too.” Up against Michael Savage Christie sounds like Eisenhower, a throwback to the Republican Party that pledged allegiance to the flag and respected the occupant of the White House, no matter what his party affiliation, because they respected the office and by extension the broader electorate.\\n\\nThat America now only exists in history.\\n\\nThis nation’s existential crisis started well before President Obama was on the scene, as any graph over the growing wealth disparity will illustrate. What ails us goes deeper than a passive and detached president who's reliably two beats behind the news wave and a Republican Party leadership committed to derailing his presidency at any cost. Even as the factions continue their war of attrition on each other, the American worker continued to fall behind, thanks to stagnant or declining wages despite increased productivity.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nThese are the same economic conditions candidate Barack Obama railed against, and before him candidate Bill Clinton. Yet from 1979 until 2013 productivity grew by almost 65 percent but average workers only saw their compensation increase by a measly 8 percent increase in those 33 years. More recently, from 2007 until 2013 the median U.S. income dropped every year and when adjusted for inflation was the lowest since 1995.\\n\\nAll you need to know about the frame of mind of Americans for the 2014 midterm was in the small print of the latest Department of Labor report on employment that came a couple of days after the election. “In October, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed at 2.9 million,” writes the Department of Labor, which translates to roughly a third of the unemployed. Civilian labor force participation continued its steady decline, hovering now at 62.8 percent, flat since April.\\n\\nLast month the DOL reported 7 million people were consigned to part-time work, even though they wanted full-time opportunities. Also in October, DOL said 2.2 million people were “marginally attached to the labor force,” a disconcerting stat DOL says “was little changed from a year earlier.” “These individuals were not in the labor force” but “had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the four weeks preceding the survey.”\\n\\nAt the same time that most U.S. households were stuck in neutral or slipping back into reverse, the top 1 percent continued to buzz by in overdrive leaving the rest of the U.S. in their dust. From the first half of 2013 to the first half of 2014, real hourly wages fell across the board with the exception of states that raised the minimum wage. Meanwhile “the wealthiest one percent captured 95 percent of the post financial crisis growth since 2009, while the bottom 90 percent became poorer,” according to the World Economic Forum’s Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nAnd while the business press chirped out happy faces over the officially declining unemployment number, the rest of the stats in the latest Department of Labor data described the ongoing wasting of a nation through workforce and wage stagnation.\\n\\nAmericans are trying to walk up the downward escalator whose motor is driven by corporate greed and bipartisan complicity. While corporations keep a lid on compensation and hiring they have increasingly become more skilled at stashing hundreds of billions of dollars in profits offshore, shifting their tax burden onto the same population that they have been squeezing for decades.\\n\\nBy some estimates as much as $2 trillion remains stashed offshore, kneecapping any real recovery. This creates a phony scarcity to help build back the pressure to get their tax cuts, shrink the federal government, help rescind the social contract and break what’s left of the American labor movement.\\n\\nHaving totally captured both political parties it is in the interests of corporations to fund the great American political kabuki dance that perpetuates the myth that on the issues that matter most to the corporations there’s a big difference between how both parties would govern. This partisan sideshow keeps the electorate distracted from the widening income disparity, wealth concentration and tax shifting that has happened under the leadership of both political parties for decades.\\n\\nIn 2008 we went for \"hope and change,\" but six years later there's this sense we are still on a downward trajectory, despite the booming stock market and gas prices dropping so fast experts are worried. Our kids are burdened with billions in debt and now the very same Wall Street vultures that created the mortgage meltdown are coming back to buy up foreclosed homes so they can rent them to the serfs who now can’t afford their own castle.\\n\\nIt is this gnawing insecurity about the prospects for our families that is the psychological fallout from the Great Recession and our wars without end. For our grandparents it was shorthanded as the \"Depression era\" mentality. It defined every choice they made but also burnished a sense of national purpose, self-sacrifice and collectivity. It beat fascism on two fronts, came home, had a parade, built the interstate highway system, and sent their soldiers to school for free. But back then we had FDR who united the population against the speculators.\\n\\nNow the speculators divide and prosper.\\n\\nToday most people grapple with their economic dislocation in isolation. The TV says we are in a recovery so it must be just me, my family, my household falling behind. Every day the TV says the market is up and yet that seems to have less and less to do with the average American family's economic well-being.\\n\\nYes, we are a war-prone republic, but we have always had periods when we collectively stood down, albeit briefly. Now we are told we are in a further notice eternal war where peace comes only when we leave this earthly plain. I don't know if the human psyche is wired for that.\\n\\nBut there is something else at work structurally that the media also shies away from because it undermines our superpower status narrative and the notion of our exceptionalism. Even talking about it one risks looking unpatriotic. For many Americans this has been the linchpin for their sense of well-being in an ever-changing world. We are just not up to coming to grips with the notion that planetary peace, prosperity and stability is truly a multilateral project. Where’s the national pride in that?\\n\\nWhen the president wasn't propping up the phony Bush war on terror narrative, he spoke eloquently about this reality as he did at West Point.\\n\\nPresident Obama is presiding in a period where in the scheme of world affairs, save the nuclear war option, the presidency is shrinking. This globally integrated marketplace we were so hell-bent to create has geopolitical consequences.\\n\\nYou can’t rely on China to finance your federal debt and not expect to lose leverage in the world. While Republicans like to put the shrinking of the presidency on the current occupant of the White House, it ignores structural things like that and the well-documented choice by U.S. multinationals and hedge funds to bet against America because they can make more money someplace else.\\n\\nIronically, these very hedge fund players that helped fund Christie’s Republican Governors Association, like Elliot Management’s Paul Singer who gave over a million dollars to the RGA, are the same crowd looking to profit from the inversion deals being cut by U.S. corporations to abandon the U.S. to reduce their U.S. tax liability.\\n\\nSo is it now, \"ask not what your country can do for you\" but which country gives you the highest rate of return?   \n",

a presidential temperament\"\\n\\nTop aides to Gov. Chris Christie communicate about lane closures to George Washington Bridge\\n\\nChristie says he knew nothing about what transpired; mayor says e-mails raise credibility questions\\n\\nThis isn't the first time critics have called New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie a bully. But now the man many consider a Republican presidential frontrunner is on the defensive, scrambling to distance himself from an erupting political scandal that threatens to tarnish his image well before the 2016 elections.\\n\\nE-mails that surfaced Wednesday suggest top Christie appointees orchestrated traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge as part of a political vendetta to punish a local mayor who wouldn't support him at the polls. Lane closures around approaches to the country's busiest bridge snarled traffic for days in September in Fort Lee, New Jersey -- a problem the governor and his administration had originally blamed on a mishandled traffic study.\\n\\nIn response to the e-mail firestorm, Christie said Wednesday that he was misled by staff. He called the conduct outrageous and said he knew nothing about it.\\n\\n\"This behavior is not representative of me or my administration in any way,\" he said, \"and people will be held responsible for their actions.\"\\n\\nEven if he had nothing to do with the traffic snarls, the allegations could have serious consequences for Christie, analysts said.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Did Christie know about traffic scandal?

He's going to have to find some way to defuse this to prove he doesn't run a shop like that,\" said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, a former adviser to several U.S. presidents.\\n\\nIt's a defining moment for Christie, CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said. And how he deals with the situation in the next two days -- from whether he fires anyone to what he says -- will be key.\\n\\n\"If he handles it decisively and then he sits down and calmly answers questions and doesn't berate the reporters who ask them, then he has a chance to be a leader who dealt with a crisis and he moves on,\" King said. \"But if that perception starts to stick in, that's not a presidential temperament. And that's bad for him nationally in his perspective. It's bad for him as he starts his new term in New Jersey. And it's bad for him with the audience he needs to care about most politically long-term at the moment, and that's the Republican base that he wants to make him their nominee.\"\\n\\nDoes this mean Christie's presidential ambitions are dashed?\\n\\n\"Not necessarily,\" Oxford University historian Timothy Stanley wrote in an opinion piece for CNN.com . \"He's a resourceful politician and it's still many months before campaigning starts in earnest. But now his opponents have a stick to beat him with. Best of all, it's an anti-government stick. If Republicans stand for anything right now, it's opposing the ability of government to mess with the individual's life -- and here we have a classic example of politicians taking revenge on each other at the expense of the average citizen.\"\\n\\nPolitical commentators from both sides of the aisle immediately recognized the potential for credibility questions, particularly around Christie's explanations in recent months about the traffic jams in Fort Lee and previous comments rejecting suggestions of political mischief.\\n\\n\"He's already cemented a narrative as something of a bully,\" said S.E. Cupp, a Republican political strategist and CNN \"Crossfire\" host. \"If this was happening in his administration, I don't think it would shocking.\"\\n\\nBut, she said, if it \"turns out he's lying about what he knew or whether he ordered it -- that's going to be the worst, the most damaging. Because his authenticity is his calling card.\"\\n\\nIt's important to ask how much Christie knew, Gergen said, but the reality might be more complicated.\\n\\n\"Sometimes the boss does not order something,\" Gergen said, describing the Nixon White House during the Watergate scandal. \"I don't know whether Nixon ordered Watergate, but I can guarantee you that people who carried out Watergate thought that's what he would have wanted. There's an environment in which you find yourself sometimes on staff when things don't have to be said. You sort of know.\"\\n\\n'Time for some traffic problems'\\n\\nThe correspondence, subpoenaed by Democrats investigating the matter and spiced with tough Jersey political talk and expletives, is the most damaging evidence so far supporting their assertions the move was orchestrated because Fort Lee's mayor, a Democrat, didn't endorse Christie's re-election.\\n\\nMayor Mark Sokolich said the traffic mess created serious hardships for commuters and other residents, and impacted public safety in his community.\\n\\nThe exchanges began three weeks before access lanes to the bridge were closed, causing heavy traffic backups between September 9 and 13, two months before Election Day.\\n\\n\"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\" Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs, said in an e-mail to David Wildstein, then the highest-level appointee representing the state at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge connecting the two states.\\n\\n\"Got it,\" Wildstein replied.\\n\\nIn another message about school buses with students onboard caught in the traffic jams, Wildstein writes, \"they are the children of Buono voters,\" apparently referring to Barbara Buono, Christie's Democratic opponent in last November's gubernatorial election.\\n\\nThose cited in the series of e-mails and text messages did not respond to requests for comment or to verify the communications.\\n\\nWildstein, who has left his job, is expected to appear at a legislative hearing on Thursday.\\n\\nDemocratic New Jersey Assembly Deputy Speaker John Wisniewski said the e-mails call into question the integrity of the governor's office.\\n\\nChristie, he said, \"has a lot of explaining to do.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe the governor called the Port Authority and said, 'Close some lanes.' But I did say I hold him responsible for the atmosphere. Now finding that that atmosphere existed in his own office is what I find really troubling,\" Wisniewski said.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED E-mails tie Christie aides to gridlock Replay More Videos ...

But I'm beginning to question my judgment,\" Sokolich said.\\n\\nThe mayor raised the issue of public safety being compromised. A letter by his emergency services coordinator, Paul Favia, on September 10 obtained by CNN cited \"new traffic patterns\" around the bridge's toll plaza that were backing up traffic in Fort Lee.\\n\\n\"This new traffic pattern is causing unnecessary delays for emergency services to arrive on scene for medical emergencies,\" Favia said, citing one case in which paramedics rushing to aid an unconscious elderly woman suffering a heart attack were held up and had to meet the ambulance transporting the victim at the hospital instead of at the scene. She later died.\\n\\nDetails surrounding the woman's death haven't been released. But the situation could deepen Christie's political woes, Gergen said.\\n\\n\"If a woman died here,\" Gergen said, \"he's in deep, deep trouble.\"\\n\\nDemocrats swarm\\n\\nChristie is now campaigning for fellow GOP governors as chairman of the Republican Governors Association and is seen as prime political target for national Democrats.\\n\\nThey rarely attacked him during his re-election campaign but are now becoming more aggressive with the bridge controversy unfolding.\\n\\n\"These revelations are troubling for any public official, but they also indicate what we've come to expect from Governor Christie - when people oppose him, he exacts retribution. When people question him, he belittles and snidely jokes. And when anyone dares to look into his administration, he bullies and attacks,\" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chair, in a statement.\\n\\nA source close to Christie said \"there will probably be some sacrificial firing and that'll be it.\"   \n",

Share Tweet Post Email\\nU.S. President Donald Trump is pushing his trade conflict with China toward a point where neither side can back down .\\nBy Aug. 30 , as the U.S. nears mid-term elections vital for Trump ’ s legislative agenda , the White House will be ready to impose 10 percent tariffs on $ 200 billion of Chinese-made products , ranging from clothing to television parts to refrigerators . The levies announced Tuesday -- together with some $ 50 billion already in the works -- stand to raise import prices on almost half of everything the U.S. buys from the Asian nation .\\nChina has seven weeks to make a deal or dig in and try to outlast the U.S. leader . President Xi Jinping , facing his own political pressures to look tough , has vowed to respond blow-for-blow . He ’ s already imposed retaliatory duties targeting Trump ’ s base including Iowa soybeans and Kentucky bourbon .\\nYet matching the latest U.S. barrage would force China to either levy much higher tariffs or take more disruptive steps like canceling purchase orders , encouraging consumer boycotts and putting up regulatory hurdles . Not only does that risk provoking Trump to follow through on threats to tax virtually all Chinese products , it could unleash nationalist sentiment on both sides that fuels a deeper struggle for geopolitical dominance .\\nTrump on Wednesday framed his trade actions as necessary to shield American businesses and farmers from harmful trading practices .\\n“ Other countries ’ trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses . I will open things up , better than ever before , but it can ’ t go too quickly , ” Trump said in a Twitter post from Brussels , where he ’ s attending a NATO summit . “ I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers , and will win ! ”\\n“ It ’ s already past the point of no return , ” said Pauline Loong , managing director at research firm Asia-Analytica in Hong Kong . “ What ’ s next is not so much a trade war or even a cold war as the dawn of an ice age in relations between China and the United States . ”\\nRead more on the escalating conflict Handbags and Cameras Hit as Trump Tariffs Target Consumers\\nYou Have a Month to Comment on Bull Semen , Vegetable Hair Tariff\\nTrump Must Meet Xi to Stop Trade War , Top House Republican Says\\nThose Cheap Chinese TVs ? They May Just Get a Lot More Expensive\\nStocks fell and commodities slid with emerging-market assets Wednesday as investors assessed the fallout . The S & P 500 Index ended the longest rally in a month and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated . While earlier tariffs were expected to have only a limited impact , economists warn a full-blown trade war could derail the strongest economic upswing in years .\\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry said Tuesday that it would be forced to retaliate against what it called “ totally unacceptable ” U.S. tariffs . There have been no confirmed high-level talks between the two sides since an early June visit to Beijing by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that achieved no breakthroughs .\\nBeijing “ never yields to threat or blackmail ” and will retaliate against the “ groundless ” tariffs , China ’ s Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said in written comments to ███ . “ The U.S. side ignored the progress , adopted unilateral and protectionist measures , and started the trade war . ”\\nWhat Our Economists Say ... “ As the targeted imports broaden to include more consumer products , a hit to household wallets and a bump to inflation could start to shift the political calculus in the U.S. , ” said ███ ’ s China economist Fielding Chen .\\nThe Aug. 30 date ensures the trade fight features prominently in November ’ s U.S. congressional elections , and the announcement exposed fissures between Trump and his Republican Party about the strategy . House Ways and Means Committee chief Kevin Brady , of Texas , warned of “ a long , multi-year trade war between the two largest economies in the world that engulfs more and more of the globe . ”\\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch , of Utah , called the new levies “ reckless ” and not “ targeted. ” Senator Chuck Grassley , a Republican from Iowa , said he had a “ great deal of concern ” about the trade spat with China and the level of uncertainty it ’ s creating among farmers and businesses in his state. “ When you don ’ t know what ’ s going to be the outcome , it ’ s very uncertain , and it ’ s had a definite impact , ” he told ███ Television . “ How long is this going to go on ? I hope we can settle pretty soon . ”\\nRead more : Some tariffs apply to flows that don ’ t exist\\nThe latest move suggests that Trump -- who in March declared that “ trade wars are good and easy to win ” -- may be compromising on his pledge to spare consumers from the pain . The tariffs could raise the prices of everything from baseball gloves to handbags to digital cameras just as voters are heading to the polls . Other high-profile items such as mobile phones have so far been spared .\\nThe U.S. felt it had no choice , but to move forward on the new tariffs after China failed to respond to the administration ’ s concerns over unfair trade practices and Beijing ’ s abuse of American intellectual property , according to two senior officials who spoke to reporters . The Trump administration has so far rejected Chinese offers to trim its massive trade surplus by buying more American goods , and is demanding more systemic change .\\n“ For over a year , the Trump administration has patiently urged China to stop its unfair practices , open its market , and engage in true market competition , ” Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement . “ China has not changed its behavior -- behavior that puts the future of the U.S. economy at risk . ”\\nAlthough the looming elections provide an immediate concern for Trump , a trade war poses a more existential concern for Xi , whose Communist Party has built its legitimacy on economic success . Prominent academics and some government officials have begun to question if China ’ s slowing , trade-dependent economy can withstand a sustained attack from Trump , which has already weighed heavily on stock prices .\\nAmong other things , the U.S. is asking China to roll back its “ Made-in-China 2025 ” program , a signature Xi initiative to dominate several strategic industries , such as semiconductors to aerospace development . Since abolishing presidential term limits , Xi has strengthened his control over the levers of power and money in China and can ’ t afford to look weak .\\n“ China is showing no signs of backing down and instead looks like it is preparing for a drawn out conflict , ” said Scott Kennedy , deputy director of China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . “ China has a million and one ways to retaliate . ”\\n— With assistance by Jenny Leonard , Andrew Mayeda , Bryce Baschuk , and Kevin Cirilli   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Pentagon ’ s top general said Tuesday that the failed special forces mission to rescue James Foley and other hostages being kept by Islamic State militants was the toughest he ’ s ever seen .\\nGen. Martin E. Dempsey , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , didn ’ t go into details , but said the effort expended should answer some of the criticisms raised that the U.S. government didn ’ t do enough to try to get hostages released .\\n“ That was the most complex , highest-risk mission we ’ ve ever taken , ” the Army general said .\\nFoley , a reporter captured in 2012 , was beheaded by an Islamic State terrorist in a brutal execution the militants filmed and released on the Internet on Aug. 19 .\\nFoley ’ s parents have complained that the U.S. government didn ’ t communicate with them about steps that were being taken to try to free him , and said they were told they could be prosecuted if they tried to pay a ransom .\\nWhile Gen. Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel wouldn ’ t go into details of the rescue mission , they said it showed they were trying to do something .\\n“ We have some limitations in our ability to collect intelligence inside Syria , but when we had the opportunity to do so , we tried to get ‘ em , ” Gen. Dempsey said .\\nMr. Hagel said that while there are boundaries to what the U.S. can do , including a strict policy that the country does not pay ransoms , officials could do a better job of “ dealing with families and the human part of this . ”\\nDuring the mission , which reportedly took place earlier in the summer , special operations forces slipped into Syria but were unable to locate Foley or other hostages , who had apparently been moved in the time since the last intelligence the U.S. had .\\nSome military officials have reportedly second-guessed President Obama ’ s decision-making , with one report saying that his hesitation to give the go-ahead reduced the chances for success .\\nThe White House , though , said Mr. Obama gave the go-ahead as soon as they believed the mission could be carried out successfully .\\nIslamic State militants have also killed American journalist Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines . But another American reporter , Peter Theo Curtis , was released late last month , apparently by the Nusra Front , an al Qaeda-linked group .   \n",
            "3  A full week after the alleged “ shellacking “ of President Obama and the Democrats , the country remains a “ stucknation ” locked in a partisan standoff where both factions hold each other in contempt and have a long list of past grievances they want to relitigate .\\nFor several years now , the two parties have so amped up the partisan rhetoric that what used to be middle ground is nothing but scorched earth . It 's a machine fueled by animus , but raises hundreds of millions of dollars for the warring factions and keeps the nation from a necessary reconciliation that 's a prerequisite for moving forward .\\nListening to this cacophony that passes for political discourse , an alien from outer space would come to the conclusion that Americans really can ’ t stand each other and just don ’ t want to defeat their opponents but annihilate them .\\nHistory is never shaped by one thing , but a confluence of trends and events . We have a president who just can ’ t figure out why everybody is not as smart as he is , and a disloyal opposition that so lusts for his demise they would shut down the government to make a rhetorical point .\\nFor many Democratic partisans , the reactionary right is waging a war on women ’ s reproductive rights and working around the clock to strip the right to vote from people of color . A key core belief of many Tea Party Republicans is that Democrats can only win elections if they steal them .\\nThis delegitimizing of the nation ’ s political process popped up for Democrats in Gore v. Bush in 2000 and now has captured conservatives , who pretty much refute the results of every election except for the ones they win . ( A notable exception was Ed Gillespie ’ s concession to Sen. Mark Warner , which went some distance in restoring the notion of a Virginian gentleman . )\\nJust spend an hour listening to national talk show host Michael Savage and his many less talented imitators that blanket the airwaves . You will hear such a deep hatred for the president you ’ ll understand that Savage and his crowd just don ’ t have contempt for the president -- but for the tens of millions of their fellow Americans that voted for him twice .\\nEven as ISIS does its thing Savage has described the sitting president as the “ enemy within ” who wants to spread Ebola , open the door to “ illegals , ” all so as to make the U.S. a third-world nation in a kind of egalitarian “ marxist ” exercise aimed at collapsing capitalism . These statements are made despite the president ’ s record deportations and unprecedented profits enjoyed by U.S. corporations during the president ’ s tenure . A mediocre chief executive he may be , but he certainly is not a marxist .\\nWhile largely ignored by the mainstream media , Savage ’ s millions of loyal listeners are also voracious readers who sent his recently released “ Stop the Coming Civil War : My Savage Truth ” on to the Barnes and Nobles big seller list . The bookseller ’ s website says Savage tells his readers “ our nation is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown . ”\\nThis near violent alienation extends into the global warming debate with one side insisting that as long as there is a God we need not worry about environmental consequences and we must burn as much fossil fuel as possible to fire up prosperity for future generations . Their opponents see these “ climate change deniers ” as a clear and present danger to the planet , funded by fossil fuel profiteers , whose only reason for existing is accumulating as much material wealth as possible so as to extend their dominion over a quickly dying planet .\\nThere is just no reconciling these alienated factions . Billions of dollars are backing up both narratives , even as the homeless stretch out in the street and West Africa begs for the basics . No wonder most Americans decided to sit out Choice 2014 .\\nIn the aftermath of the 2014 midterms , the milquetoast political press offers a ho-hum narrative dominated by the politicians ' personal story . What ’ s President Obama ’ s legacy ? Which Republican will claim the 2016 nomination ? How do the results of 2014 impact former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’ s chances to win the presidency ?\\nRank them . Sort them . Do whatever your cyberalgorithms tell you will get the most eyeballs . The political reporting is so fixated on who 's winning or falling behind that the horse race eclipses the actual economic and social conditions of the country . What they seem to be missing is just how badly polarized the nation is and just how many American households are still falling behind .\\nAs for the voters ' hearts and minds , they get their shot during the exit polls . Based on those polls Republicans would be mistaken to interpret their victory as some kind of blank check . As the New York Times reported , voters surveyed this time around were skeptical of both parties . They believed the U.S. economy is rigged for the 1 percent and are doubtful their children will do better than they have .\\nThere is something that is ruminating out there beyond the Beltway and the safe green zone of the corporate media that acts as its buffer . Looking at the “ right way-wrong way ” survey data by the NBC News/Wall Street Journal it has pretty much been all downhill from right after the Sept. 11 attack . That was when just over 70 percent of those surveyed thought the nation was headed in the right direction as ground zero still smoldered , the nation pulled together and the world embraced us as a victim of terrorism .\\nBy this summer , more than 12 years into our global war on terror , and a few years into the “ recovery , ” that same poll was totally upside down with 70 percent now saying the nation was headed in the wrong direction . In the immediate run-up to the midterms the president said U.S. intelligence missed the rise of ISIS , the Secret Service left the front door of the White House and the Centers for Disease Control fumbled the initial response of Ebola .\\nMost all the Democrats ran away from the president . Consistently the president was a couple of beats behind the breaking news where his handlers must have thought it was safe . Whether it was responding to the wave of undocumented children crossing the border , ISIS or Ebola the White House waited for events to play out for weeks and even months , and only when the media declared a “ crisis , ” would we get presidential action . It was as if President Obama ’ s heart wasn ’ t in doing his job .\\nOff course for the Savage contingent this passiveness was extrapolated as premeditation and diabolical planning to collapse the nation into an oozing morass of disease and lawless chaos .\\nThe president ’ s poor performance , whatever the reason for it , had consequences down ballot . Republicans not only won the U.S. Senate but they now hold 31 of the nation ’ s governorships , replacing Democrats in Arkansas , Illinois , Massachusetts and Maryland . The GOP now has total control , that is the governorship and the state legislatures , in 21 states compared to the Democrats who now have a third of that many .\\nIn the state races there were no doubt local issues also in play . Yet New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , who led the Republican Governors Association 's bid to capture as many state capitals as possible , says in the 35 states he visited voters expressed major anxiety about the president ’ s lack of leadership . “ I wouldn ’ t call it fear . I ’ d call it anxiety , really anxious . I think the best way to describe it was a woman I met who told me she was in her 80s from Vero Beach and she said to me , 'Governor what 's happened to our country ? We used to control events , now events control us . ' ”\\n“ I think the reason folks are anxious is they feel like the president is weak and as a result our country is perceived to be weak , ” Christie told reporters after he voted . “ I think the country is looking for the president to be strong and I wish he would be . He ’ s my president too. ” Up against Michael Savage Christie sounds like Eisenhower , a throwback to the Republican Party that pledged allegiance to the flag and respected the occupant of the White House , no matter what his party affiliation , because they respected the office and by extension the broader electorate .\\nThis nation ’ s existential crisis started well before President Obama was on the scene , as any graph over the growing wealth disparity will illustrate . What ails us goes deeper than a passive and detached president who 's reliably two beats behind the news wave and a Republican Party leadership committed to derailing his presidency at any cost . Even as the factions continue their war of attrition on each other , the American worker continued to fall behind , thanks to stagnant or declining wages despite increased productivity .\\nThese are the same economic conditions candidate Barack Obama railed against , and before him candidate Bill Clinton . Yet from 1979 until 2013 productivity grew by almost 65 percent but average workers only saw their compensation increase by a measly 8 percent increase in those 33 years . More recently , from 2007 until 2013 the median U.S. income dropped every year and when adjusted for inflation was the lowest since 1995 .\\nAll you need to know about the frame of mind of Americans for the 2014 midterm was in the small print of the latest Department of Labor report on employment that came a couple of days after the election . “ In October , the number of long-term unemployed ( those jobless for 27 weeks or more ) was little changed at 2.9 million , ” writes the Department of Labor , which translates to roughly a third of the unemployed . Civilian labor force participation continued its steady decline , hovering now at 62.8 percent , flat since April .\\nLast month the DOL reported 7 million people were consigned to part-time work , even though they wanted full-time opportunities . Also in October , DOL said 2.2 million people were “ marginally attached to the labor force , ” a disconcerting stat DOL says “ was little changed from a year earlier. ” “ These individuals were not in the labor force ” but “ had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months . They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the four weeks preceding the survey . ”\\nAt the same time that most U.S. households were stuck in neutral or slipping back into reverse , the top 1 percent continued to buzz by in overdrive leaving the rest of the U.S. in their dust . From the first half of 2013 to the first half of 2014 , real hourly wages fell across the board with the exception of states that raised the minimum wage . Meanwhile “ the wealthiest one percent captured 95 percent of the post financial crisis growth since 2009 , while the bottom 90 percent became poorer , ” according to the World Economic Forum ’ s Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 .\\nAnd while the business press chirped out happy faces over the officially declining unemployment number , the rest of the stats in the latest Department of Labor data described the ongoing wasting of a nation through workforce and wage stagnation .\\nAmericans are trying to walk up the downward escalator whose motor is driven by corporate greed and bipartisan complicity . While corporations keep a lid on compensation and hiring they have increasingly become more skilled at stashing hundreds of billions of dollars in profits offshore , shifting their tax burden onto the same population that they have been squeezing for decades .\\nBy some estimates as much as $ 2 trillion remains stashed offshore , kneecapping any real recovery . This creates a phony scarcity to help build back the pressure to get their tax cuts , shrink the federal government , help rescind the social contract and break what ’ s left of the American labor movement .\\nHaving totally captured both political parties it is in the interests of corporations to fund the great American political kabuki dance that perpetuates the myth that on the issues that matter most to the corporations there ’ s a big difference between how both parties would govern . This partisan sideshow keeps the electorate distracted from the widening income disparity , wealth concentration and tax shifting that has happened under the leadership of both political parties for decades .\\nIn 2008 we went for `` hope and change , '' but six years later there 's this sense we are still on a downward trajectory , despite the booming stock market and gas prices dropping so fast experts are worried . Our kids are burdened with billions in debt and now the very same Wall Street vultures that created the mortgage meltdown are coming back to buy up foreclosed homes so they can rent them to the serfs who now can ’ t afford their own castle .\\nIt is this gnawing insecurity about the prospects for our families that is the psychological fallout from the Great Recession and our wars without end . For our grandparents it was shorthanded as the `` Depression era '' mentality . It defined every choice they made but also burnished a sense of national purpose , self-sacrifice and collectivity . It beat fascism on two fronts , came home , had a parade , built the interstate highway system , and sent their soldiers to school for free . But back then we had FDR who united the population against the speculators .\\nToday most people grapple with their economic dislocation in isolation . The TV says we are in a recovery so it must be just me , my family , my household falling behind . Every day the TV says the market is up and yet that seems to have less and less to do with the average American family 's economic well-being .\\nYes , we are a war-prone republic , but we have always had periods when we collectively stood down , albeit briefly . Now we are told we are in a further notice eternal war where peace comes only when we leave this earthly plain . I do n't know if the human psyche is wired for that .\\nBut there is something else at work structurally that the media also shies away from because it undermines our superpower status narrative and the notion of our exceptionalism . Even talking about it one risks looking unpatriotic . For many Americans this has been the linchpin for their sense of well-being in an ever-changing world . We are just not up to coming to grips with the notion that planetary peace , prosperity and stability is truly a multilateral project . Where ’ s the national pride in that ?\\nWhen the president was n't propping up the phony Bush war on terror narrative , he spoke eloquently about this reality as he did at West Point .\\nPresident Obama is presiding in a period where in the scheme of world affairs , save the nuclear war option , the presidency is shrinking . This globally integrated marketplace we were so hell-bent to create has geopolitical consequences .\\nYou can ’ t rely on China to finance your federal debt and not expect to lose leverage in the world . While Republicans like to put the shrinking of the presidency on the current occupant of the White House , it ignores structural things like that and the well-documented choice by U.S. multinationals and hedge funds to bet against America because they can make more money someplace else .\\nIronically , these very hedge fund players that helped fund Christie ’ s Republican Governors Association , like Elliot Management ’ s Paul Singer who gave over a million dollars to the RGA , are the same crowd looking to profit from the inversion deals being cut by U.S. corporations to abandon the U.S. to reduce their U.S. tax liability .\\nSo is it now , `` ask not what your country can do for you '' but which country gives you the highest rate of return ?   \n",

It feeds into this narrative that he 's a bully ''\\nKing : `` If that perception starts to stick in , that 's not a presidential temperament ''\\nTop aides to Gov . Chris Christie communicate about lane closures to George Washington Bridge\\nChristie says he knew nothing about what transpired ; mayor says e-mails raise credibility questions\\nThis is n't the first time critics have called New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie a bully . But now the man many consider a Republican presidential frontrunner is on the defensive , scrambling to distance himself from an erupting political scandal that threatens to tarnish his image well before the 2016 elections .\\nE-mails that surfaced Wednesday suggest top Christie appointees orchestrated traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge as part of a political vendetta to punish a local mayor who would n't support him at the polls . Lane closures around approaches to the country 's busiest bridge snarled traffic for days in September in Fort Lee , New Jersey -- a problem the governor and his administration had originally blamed on a mishandled traffic study .\\nIn response to the e-mail firestorm , Christie said Wednesday that he was misled by staff . He called the conduct outrageous and said he knew nothing about it .\\n`` This behavior is not representative of me or my administration in any way , '' he said , `` and people will be held responsible for their actions . ''\\nEven if he had nothing to do with the traffic snarls , the allegations could have serious consequences for Christie , analysts said .\\nJUST WATCHED Did Christie know about traffic scandal ?

He 's going to have to find some way to defuse this to prove he does n't run a shop like that , '' said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen , a former adviser to several U.S. presidents .\\nIt 's a defining moment for Christie , CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said . And how he deals with the situation in the next two days -- from whether he fires anyone to what he says -- will be key .\\n`` If he handles it decisively and then he sits down and calmly answers questions and does n't berate the reporters who ask them , then he has a chance to be a leader who dealt with a crisis and he moves on , '' King said . `` But if that perception starts to stick in , that 's not a presidential temperament . And that 's bad for him nationally in his perspective . It 's bad for him as he starts his new term in New Jersey . And it 's bad for him with the audience he needs to care about most politically long-term at the moment , and that 's the Republican base that he wants to make him their nominee . ''\\n`` Not necessarily , '' Oxford University historian Timothy Stanley wrote in an opinion piece for CNN.com . `` He 's a resourceful politician and it 's still many months before campaigning starts in earnest . But now his opponents have a stick to beat him with . Best of all , it 's an anti-government stick . If Republicans stand for anything right now , it 's opposing the ability of government to mess with the individual 's life -- and here we have a classic example of politicians taking revenge on each other at the expense of the average citizen . ''\\nPolitical commentators from both sides of the aisle immediately recognized the potential for credibility questions , particularly around Christie 's explanations in recent months about the traffic jams in Fort Lee and previous comments rejecting suggestions of political mischief .\\n`` He 's already cemented a narrative as something of a bully , '' said S.E . Cupp , a Republican political strategist and CNN `` Crossfire '' host . `` If this was happening in his administration , I do n't think it would shocking . ''\\nBut , she said , if it `` turns out he 's lying about what he knew or whether he ordered it -- that 's going to be the worst , the most damaging . Because his authenticity is his calling card . ''\\nIt 's important to ask how much Christie knew , Gergen said , but the reality might be more complicated .\\n`` Sometimes the boss does not order something , '' Gergen said , describing the Nixon White House during the Watergate scandal . `` I do n't know whether Nixon ordered Watergate , but I can guarantee you that people who carried out Watergate thought that 's what he would have wanted . There 's an environment in which you find yourself sometimes on staff when things do n't have to be said . You sort of know . ''\\nThe correspondence , subpoenaed by Democrats investigating the matter and spiced with tough Jersey political talk and expletives , is the most damaging evidence so far supporting their assertions the move was orchestrated because Fort Lee 's mayor , a Democrat , did n't endorse Christie 's re-election .\\nMayor Mark Sokolich said the traffic mess created serious hardships for commuters and other residents , and impacted public safety in his community .\\nThe exchanges began three weeks before access lanes to the bridge were closed , causing heavy traffic backups between September 9 and 13 , two months before Election Day .\\n`` Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee , '' Bridget Anne Kelly , Christie 's deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs , said in an e-mail to David Wildstein , then the highest-level appointee representing the state at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , which operates the bridge connecting the two states .\\nIn another message about school buses with students onboard caught in the traffic jams , Wildstein writes , `` they are the children of Buono voters , '' apparently referring to Barbara Buono , Christie 's Democratic opponent in last November 's gubernatorial election .\\nThose cited in the series of e-mails and text messages did not respond to requests for comment or to verify the communications .\\nWildstein , who has left his job , is expected to appear at a legislative hearing on Thursday .\\nDemocratic New Jersey Assembly Deputy Speaker John Wisniewski said the e-mails call into question the integrity of the governor 's office .\\nChristie , he said , `` has a lot of explaining to do . ''\\n`` I do not believe the governor called the Port Authority and said , 'Close some lanes . ' But I did say I hold him responsible for the atmosphere . Now finding that that atmosphere existed in his own office is what I find really troubling , '' Wisniewski said .\\nJUST WATCHED E-mails tie Christie aides to gridlock Replay More Videos ...

But I 'm beginning to question my judgment , '' Sokolich said .\\nThe mayor raised the issue of public safety being compromised . A letter by his emergency services coordinator , Paul Favia , on September 10 obtained by CNN cited `` new traffic patterns '' around the bridge 's toll plaza that were backing up traffic in Fort Lee .\\n`` This new traffic pattern is causing unnecessary delays for emergency services to arrive on scene for medical emergencies , '' Favia said , citing one case in which paramedics rushing to aid an unconscious elderly woman suffering a heart attack were held up and had to meet the ambulance transporting the victim at the hospital instead of at the scene . She later died .\\nDetails surrounding the woman 's death have n't been released . But the situation could deepen Christie 's political woes , Gergen said .\\n`` If a woman died here , '' Gergen said , `` he 's in deep , deep trouble . ''\\nChristie is now campaigning for fellow GOP governors as chairman of the Republican Governors Association and is seen as prime political target for national Democrats .\\nThey rarely attacked him during his re-election campaign but are now becoming more aggressive with the bridge controversy unfolding .\\n`` These revelations are troubling for any public official , but they also indicate what we 've come to expect from Governor Christie - when people oppose him , he exacts retribution . When people question him , he belittles and snidely jokes . And when anyone dares to look into his administration , he bullies and attacks , '' said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , the Democratic National Committee chair , in a statement .\\nA source close to Christie said `` there will probably be some sacrificial firing and that 'll be it .

out\\nSnowden wants to return home , but he wants protection from prosecution\\nEdward Snowden may stay in Russia longer than first thought .\\nSnowden has said the time is n't right for him to return to the United States , where he could face criminal charges for leaking classified information . Russia gave him asylum for a year .\\nNow Russia says it will continue to extend asylum protections to Snowden and wo n't send him back home .\\nThat word came Friday from Alexy Pushkov , a legislator who is head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Duma , Russia 's lower house . He spoke about Snowden at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .\\nRussia 's position basically buys Snowden more time as he mulls his next move .\\nJUST WATCHED Edward Snowden responds to CNN Replay More Videos ...

Holder discusses Snowden case Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Atty Gen. Holder discusses Snowden case 01:36\\nSnowden has said he wants to return home but also wants whistle-blower protection . The U.S. government , meanwhile , says it will not offer clemency .\\nIn an online chat Thursday , Snowden said that returning to the U.S. `` is the best resolution for all parties , '' but `` it 's unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistle-blower protection laws . ''\\nHe pointed out that the U.S. government 's Whistleblower Protection Act does n't cover someone like him , a former government contractor .\\n`` There are so many holes in the laws , the protections they afford are so weak , and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing , '' he wrote . `` ... My case clearly demonstrates the need for comprehensive whistle-blower protection act reform . ''\\nSnowden offered his remarks from Russia , where he 's been since June , having been granted a one-year asylum . Pushkov 's remarks appear to open the door to an extension of that asylum .\\nThe U.S. government has n't stayed silent on his case , either .\\nOn Thursday , around the time that Snowden was answering questions online , Attorney General Eric Holder said that `` if Mr. Snowden wanted to come back to the United States and enter a plea , we would engage with his lawyers . ''\\nThe government would take the same tack with anyone willing to plead guilty , Holder said at an event at the University of Virginia 's Miller Center .\\nBut in Snowden 's case , the attorney general insisted , `` Clemency is n't something that we ( are ) willing to consider .

is pushing his trade conflict with China toward a point where neither side can back down.\\n\\nBy Aug. 30, as the U.S. nears mid-term elections vital for Trump’s legislative agenda, the White House will be ready to impose 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese-made products, ranging from clothing to television parts to refrigerators. The levies announced Tuesday -- together with some $50 billion already in the works -- stand to raise import prices on almost half of everything the U.S. buys from the Asian nation.\\n\\nChina has seven weeks to make a deal or dig in and try to outlast the U.S. leader. President Xi Jinping, facing his own political pressures to look tough, has vowed to respond blow-for-blow. He’s already imposed retaliatory duties targeting Trump’s base including Iowa soybeans and Kentucky bourbon.\\n\\nYet matching the latest U.S. barrage would force China to either levy much higher tariffs or take more disruptive steps like canceling purchase orders, encouraging consumer boycotts and putting up regulatory hurdles. Not only does that risk provoking Trump to follow through on threats to tax virtually all Chinese products, it could unleash nationalist sentiment on both sides that fuels a deeper struggle for geopolitical dominance.\\n\\nTrump on Wednesday framed his trade actions as necessary to shield American businesses and farmers from harmful trading practices.\\n\\n“Other countries’ trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses. I will open things up, better than ever before, but it can’t go too quickly,” Trump said in a Twitter post from Brussels, where he’s attending a NATO summit. “I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win!”\\n\\n“It’s already past the point of no return,” said Pauline Loong, managing director at research firm Asia-Analytica in Hong Kong. “What’s next is not so much a trade war or even a cold war as the dawn of an ice age in relations between China and the United States.”\\n\\nRead more on the escalating conflict Handbags and Cameras Hit as Trump Tariffs Target Consumers\\n\\nYou Have a Month to Comment on Bull Semen, Vegetable Hair Tariff\\n\\nTrump Must Meet Xi to Stop Trade War, Top House Republican Says\\n\\nThose Cheap Chinese TVs? They May Just Get a Lot More Expensive\\n\\nStocks fell and commodities slid with emerging-market assets Wednesday as investors assessed the fallout. The S&P 500 Index ended the longest rally in a month and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated. While earlier tariffs were expected to have only a limited impact, economists warn a full-blown trade war could derail the strongest economic upswing in years.\\n\\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry said Tuesday that it would be forced to retaliate against what it called “ totally unacceptable” U.S. tariffs. There have been no confirmed high-level talks between the two sides since an early June visit to Beijing by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that achieved no breakthroughs.\\n\\nBeijing “never yields to threat or blackmail” and will retaliate against the “groundless” tariffs, China’s Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said in written comments to Bloomberg. “The U.S. side ignored the progress, adopted unilateral and protectionist measures, and started the trade war.”\\n\\nWhat Our Economists Say... “As the targeted imports broaden to include more consumer products, a hit to household wallets and a bump to inflation could start to shift the political calculus in the U.S.,” said Bloomberg’s China economist Fielding Chen.\\n\\nThe Aug. 30 date ensures the trade fight features prominently in November’s U.S. congressional elections, and the announcement exposed fissures between Trump and his Republican Party about the strategy. House Ways and Means Committee chief Kevin Brady, of Texas, warned of “a long, multi-year trade war between the two largest economies in the world that engulfs more and more of the globe.”\\n\\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, of Utah, called the new levies “reckless” and not “targeted.” Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, said he had a “great deal of concern” about the trade spat with China and the level of uncertainty it’s creating among farmers and businesses in his state.“When you don’t know what’s going to be the outcome, it’s very uncertain, and it’s had a definite impact,” he told Bloomberg Television. “How long is this going to go on? I hope we can settle pretty soon.”\\n\\nRead more: Some tariffs apply to flows that don’t exist\\n\\nThe latest move suggests that Trump -- who in March declared that “trade wars are good and easy to win” -- may be compromising on his pledge to spare consumers from the pain. The tariffs could raise the prices of everything from baseball gloves to handbags to digital cameras just as voters are heading to the polls. Other high-profile items such as mobile phones have so far been spared.\\n\\nUnfair Practices\\n\\nThe U.S. felt it had no choice, but to move forward on the new tariffs after China failed to respond to the administration’s concerns over unfair trade practices and Beijing’s abuse of American intellectual property, according to two senior officials who spoke to reporters. The Trump administration has so far rejected Chinese offers to trim its massive trade surplus by buying more American goods, and is demanding more systemic change.\\n\\n“For over a year, the Trump administration has patiently urged China to stop its unfair practices, open its market, and engage in true market competition,” Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement. “China has not changed its behavior -- behavior that puts the future of the U.S. economy at risk.”\\n\\nAlthough the looming elections provide an immediate concern for Trump, a trade war poses a more existential concern for Xi, whose Communist Party has built its legitimacy on economic success. Prominent academics and some government officials have begun to question if China’s slowing, trade-dependent economy can withstand a sustained attack from Trump, which has already weighed heavily on stock prices.\\n\\nAmong other things, the U.S. is asking China to roll back its “Made-in-China 2025” program, a signature Xi initiative to dominate several strategic industries, such as semiconductors to aerospace development. Since abolishing presidential term limits, Xi has strengthened his control over the levers of power and money in China and can’t afford to look weak.\\n\\n“China is showing no signs of backing down and instead looks like it is preparing for a drawn out conflict,” said Scott Kennedy, deputy director of China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “China has a million and one ways to retaliate.”\\n\\n— With assistance by Jenny Leonard, Andrew Mayeda, Bryce Baschuk, and Kevin Cirilli   \n",

general said Tuesday that the failed special forces mission to rescue James Foley and other hostages being kept by Islamic State militants was the toughest he’s ever seen.\\n\\nGen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, didn’t go into details, but said the effort expended should answer some of the criticisms raised that the U.S. government didn’t do enough to try to get hostages released.\\n\\n“That was the most complex, highest-risk mission we’ve ever taken,” the Army general said.\\n\\nFoley, a reporter captured in 2012, was beheaded by an Islamic State terrorist in a brutal execution the militants filmed and released on the Internet on Aug. 19.\\n\\nFoley’s parents have complained that the U.S. government didn’t communicate with them about steps that were being taken to try to free him, and said they were told they could be prosecuted if they tried to pay a ransom.\\n\\nWhile Gen. Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel wouldn’t go into details of the rescue mission, they said it showed they were trying to do something.\\n\\n“We have some limitations in our ability to collect intelligence inside Syria, but when we had the opportunity to do so, we tried to get ‘em,” Gen. Dempsey said.\\n\\nMr. Hagel said that while there are boundaries to what the U.S. can do, including a strict policy that the country does not pay ransoms, officials could do a better job of “dealing with families and the human part of this.”\\n\\nDuring the mission, which reportedly took place earlier in the summer, special operations forces slipped into Syria but were unable to locate Foley or other hostages, who had apparently been moved in the time since the last intelligence the U.S. had.\\n\\nSome military officials have reportedly second-guessed President Obama’s decision-making, with one report saying that his hesitation to give the go-ahead reduced the chances for success.\\n\\nThe White House, though, said Mr. Obama gave the go-ahead as soon as they believed the mission could be carried out successfully.\\n\\nIslamic State militants have also killed American journalist Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines. But another American reporter, Peter Theo Curtis, was released late last month, apparently by the Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-linked group.\\n\\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\\n\\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

            "3  A full week after the alleged “shellacking “ of President Obama and the Democrats, the country remains a “stucknation” locked in a partisan standoff where both factions hold each other in contempt and have a long list of past grievances they want to relitigate.\\n\\nFor several years now, the two parties have so amped up the partisan rhetoric that what used to be middle ground is nothing but scorched earth. It's a machine fueled by animus, but raises hundreds of millions of dollars for the warring factions and keeps the nation from a necessary reconciliation that's a prerequisite for moving forward.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nListening to this cacophony that passes for political discourse, an alien from outer space would come to the conclusion that Americans really can’t stand each other and just don’t want to defeat their opponents but annihilate them.\\n\\nNo wonder Putin sent his armor into the Ukraine.\\n\\nHistory is never shaped by one thing, but a confluence of trends and events. We have a president who just can’t figure out why everybody is not as smart as he is, and a disloyal opposition that so lusts for his demise they would shut down the government to make a rhetorical point.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nFor many Democratic partisans, the reactionary right is waging a war on women’s reproductive rights and working around the clock to strip the right to vote from people of color. A key core belief of many Tea Party Republicans is that Democrats can only win elections if they steal them.\\n\\nThis delegitimizing of the nation’s political process popped up for Democrats in Gore v. Bush in 2000 and now has captured conservatives, who pretty much refute the results of every election except for the ones they win. (A notable exception was Ed Gillespie’s concession to Sen. Mark Warner, which went some distance in restoring the notion of a Virginian gentleman.)\\n\\nJust spend an hour listening to national talk show host Michael Savage and his many less talented imitators that blanket the airwaves. You will hear such a deep hatred for the president you’ll understand that Savage and his crowd just don’t have contempt for the president -- but for the tens of millions of their fellow Americans that voted for him twice.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nEven as ISIS does its thing Savage has described the sitting president as the “enemy within” who wants to spread Ebola, open the door to “illegals,” all so as to make the U.S. a third-world nation in a kind of egalitarian “marxist” exercise aimed at collapsing capitalism. These statements are made despite the president’s record deportations and unprecedented profits enjoyed by U.S. corporations during the president’s tenure. A mediocre chief executive he may be, but he certainly is not a marxist.\\n\\nWhile largely ignored by the mainstream media, Savage’s millions of loyal listeners are also voracious readers who sent his recently released “Stop the Coming Civil War: My Savage Truth” on to the Barnes and Nobles big seller list. The bookseller’s website says Savage tells his readers “our nation is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown.”\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nThis near violent alienation extends into the global warming debate with one side insisting that as long as there is a God we need not worry about environmental consequences and we must burn as much fossil fuel as possible to fire up prosperity for future generations. Their opponents see these “climate change deniers” as a clear and present danger to the planet, funded by fossil fuel profiteers, whose only reason for existing is accumulating as much material wealth as possible so as to extend their dominion over a quickly dying planet.\\n\\nThere is just no reconciling these alienated factions. Billions of dollars are backing up both narratives, even as the homeless stretch out in the street and West Africa begs for the basics. No wonder most Americans decided to sit out Choice 2014.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the 2014 midterms, the milquetoast political press offers a ho-hum narrative dominated by the politicians' personal story. What’s President Obama’s legacy? Which Republican will claim the 2016 nomination? How do the results of 2014 impact former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s chances to win the presidency?\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nRank them. Sort them. Do whatever your cyberalgorithms tell you will get the most eyeballs. The political reporting is so fixated on who's winning or falling behind that the horse race eclipses the actual economic and social conditions of the country. What they seem to be missing is just how badly polarized the nation is and just how many American households are still falling behind.\\n\\nAs for the voters' hearts and minds, they get their shot during the exit polls. Based on those polls Republicans would be mistaken to interpret their victory as some kind of blank check. As the New York Times reported, voters surveyed this time around were skeptical of both parties. They believed the U.S. economy is rigged for the 1 percent and are doubtful their children will do better than they have.\\n\\nThere is something that is ruminating out there beyond the Beltway and the safe green zone of the corporate media that acts as its buffer. Looking at the “right way-wrong way” survey data by the NBC News/Wall Street Journal it has pretty much been all downhill from right after the Sept. 11 attack. That was when just over 70 percent of those surveyed thought the nation was headed in the right direction as ground zero still smoldered, the nation pulled together and the world embraced us as a victim of terrorism.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nBy this summer, more than 12 years into our global war on terror, and a few years into the “recovery,” that same poll was totally upside down with 70 percent now saying the nation was headed in the wrong direction. In the immediate run-up to the midterms the president said U.S. intelligence missed the rise of ISIS, the Secret Service left the front door of the White House and the Centers for Disease Control fumbled the initial response of Ebola.\\n\\nMost all the Democrats ran away from the president. Consistently the president was a couple of beats behind the breaking news where his handlers must have thought it was safe. Whether it was responding to the wave of undocumented children crossing the border, ISIS or Ebola the White House waited for events to play out for weeks and even months, and only when the media declared a “crisis,” would we get presidential action. It was as if President Obama’s heart wasn’t in doing his job.\\n\\nOff course for the Savage contingent this passiveness was extrapolated as premeditation and diabolical planning to collapse the nation into an oozing morass of disease and lawless chaos.\\n\\nThe president’s poor performance, whatever the reason for it, had consequences down ballot. Republicans not only won the U.S. Senate but they now hold 31 of the nation’s governorships, replacing Democrats in Arkansas, Illinois, Massachusetts and Maryland. The GOP now has total control, that is the governorship and the state legislatures, in 21 states compared to the Democrats who now have a third of that many.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nIn the state races there were no doubt local issues also in play. Yet New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who led the Republican Governors Association's bid to capture as many state capitals as possible, says in the 35 states he visited voters expressed major anxiety about the president’s lack of leadership. “I wouldn’t call it fear. I’d call it anxiety, really anxious. I think the best way to describe it was a woman I met who told me she was in her 80s from Vero Beach and she said to me, 'Governor what's happened to our country? We used to control events, now events control us.'”\\n\\n“I think the reason folks are anxious is they feel like the president is weak and as a result our country is perceived to be weak,” Christie told reporters after he voted. “I think the country is looking for the president to be strong and I wish he would be. He’s my president too.” Up against Michael Savage Christie sounds like Eisenhower, a throwback to the Republican Party that pledged allegiance to the flag and respected the occupant of the White House, no matter what his party affiliation, because they respected the office and by extension the broader electorate.\\n\\nThat America now only exists in history.\\n\\nThis nation’s existential crisis started well before President Obama was on the scene, as any graph over the growing wealth disparity will illustrate. What ails us goes deeper than a passive and detached president who's reliably two beats behind the news wave and a Republican Party leadership committed to derailing his presidency at any cost. Even as the factions continue their war of attrition on each other, the American worker continued to fall behind, thanks to stagnant or declining wages despite increased productivity.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nThese are the same economic conditions candidate Barack Obama railed against, and before him candidate Bill Clinton. Yet from 1979 until 2013 productivity grew by almost 65 percent but average workers only saw their compensation increase by a measly 8 percent increase in those 33 years. More recently, from 2007 until 2013 the median U.S. income dropped every year and when adjusted for inflation was the lowest since 1995.\\n\\nAll you need to know about the frame of mind of Americans for the 2014 midterm was in the small print of the latest Department of Labor report on employment that came a couple of days after the election. “In October, the number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed at 2.9 million,” writes the Department of Labor, which translates to roughly a third of the unemployed. Civilian labor force participation continued its steady decline, hovering now at 62.8 percent, flat since April.\\n\\nLast month the DOL reported 7 million people were consigned to part-time work, even though they wanted full-time opportunities. Also in October, DOL said 2.2 million people were “marginally attached to the labor force,” a disconcerting stat DOL says “was little changed from a year earlier.” “These individuals were not in the labor force” but “had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the four weeks preceding the survey.”\\n\\nAt the same time that most U.S. households were stuck in neutral or slipping back into reverse, the top 1 percent continued to buzz by in overdrive leaving the rest of the U.S. in their dust. From the first half of 2013 to the first half of 2014, real hourly wages fell across the board with the exception of states that raised the minimum wage. Meanwhile “the wealthiest one percent captured 95 percent of the post financial crisis growth since 2009, while the bottom 90 percent became poorer,” according to the World Economic Forum’s Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014.\\n\\nAdvertisement:\\n\\nAnd while the business press chirped out happy faces over the officially declining unemployment number, the rest of the stats in the latest Department of Labor data described the ongoing wasting of a nation through workforce and wage stagnation.\\n\\nAmericans are trying to walk up the downward escalator whose motor is driven by corporate greed and bipartisan complicity. While corporations keep a lid on compensation and hiring they have increasingly become more skilled at stashing hundreds of billions of dollars in profits offshore, shifting their tax burden onto the same population that they have been squeezing for decades.\\n\\nBy some estimates as much as $2 trillion remains stashed offshore, kneecapping any real recovery. This creates a phony scarcity to help build back the pressure to get their tax cuts, shrink the federal government, help rescind the social contract and break what’s left of the American labor movement.\\n\\nHaving totally captured both political parties it is in the interests of corporations to fund the great American political kabuki dance that perpetuates the myth that on the issues that matter most to the corporations there’s a big difference between how both parties would govern. This partisan sideshow keeps the electorate distracted from the widening income disparity, wealth concentration and tax shifting that has happened under the leadership of both political parties for decades.\\n\\nIn 2008 we went for \"hope and change,\" but six years later there's this sense we are still on a downward trajectory, despite the booming stock market and gas prices dropping so fast experts are worried. Our kids are burdened with billions in debt and now the very same Wall Street vultures that created the mortgage meltdown are coming back to buy up foreclosed homes so they can rent them to the serfs who now can’t afford their own castle.\\n\\nIt is this gnawing insecurity about the prospects for our families that is the psychological fallout from the Great Recession and our wars without end. For our grandparents it was shorthanded as the \"Depression era\" mentality. It defined every choice they made but also burnished a sense of national purpose, self-sacrifice and collectivity. It beat fascism on two fronts, came home, had a parade, built the interstate highway system, and sent their soldiers to school for free. But back then we had FDR who united the population against the speculators.\\n\\nNow the speculators divide and prosper.\\n\\nToday most people grapple with their economic dislocation in isolation. The TV says we are in a recovery so it must be just me, my family, my household falling behind. Every day the TV says the market is up and yet that seems to have less and less to do with the average American family's economic well-being.\\n\\nYes, we are a war-prone republic, but we have always had periods when we collectively stood down, albeit briefly. Now we are told we are in a further notice eternal war where peace comes only when we leave this earthly plain. I don't know if the human psyche is wired for that.\\n\\nBut there is something else at work structurally that the media also shies away from because it undermines our superpower status narrative and the notion of our exceptionalism. Even talking about it one risks looking unpatriotic. For many Americans this has been the linchpin for their sense of well-being in an ever-changing world. We are just not up to coming to grips with the notion that planetary peace, prosperity and stability is truly a multilateral project. Where’s the national pride in that?\\n\\nWhen the president wasn't propping up the phony Bush war on terror narrative, he spoke eloquently about this reality as he did at West Point.\\n\\nPresident Obama is presiding in a period where in the scheme of world affairs, save the nuclear war option, the presidency is shrinking. This globally integrated marketplace we were so hell-bent to create has geopolitical consequences.\\n\\nYou can’t rely on China to finance your federal debt and not expect to lose leverage in the world. While Republicans like to put the shrinking of the presidency on the current occupant of the White House, it ignores structural things like that and the well-documented choice by U.S. multinationals and hedge funds to bet against America because they can make more money someplace else.\\n\\nIronically, these very hedge fund players that helped fund Christie’s Republican Governors Association, like Elliot Management’s Paul Singer who gave over a million dollars to the RGA, are the same crowd looking to profit from the inversion deals being cut by U.S. corporations to abandon the U.S. to reduce their U.S. tax liability.\\n\\nSo is it now, \"ask not what your country can do for you\" but which country gives you the highest rate of return?   \n",

a presidential temperament\"\\n\\nTop aides to Gov. Chris Christie communicate about lane closures to George Washington Bridge\\n\\nChristie says he knew nothing about what transpired; mayor says e-mails raise credibility questions\\n\\nThis isn't the first time critics have called New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie a bully. But now the man many consider a Republican presidential frontrunner is on the defensive, scrambling to distance himself from an erupting political scandal that threatens to tarnish his image well before the 2016 elections.\\n\\nE-mails that surfaced Wednesday suggest top Christie appointees orchestrated traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge as part of a political vendetta to punish a local mayor who wouldn't support him at the polls. Lane closures around approaches to the country's busiest bridge snarled traffic for days in September in Fort Lee, New Jersey -- a problem the governor and his administration had originally blamed on a mishandled traffic study.\\n\\nIn response to the e-mail firestorm, Christie said Wednesday that he was misled by staff. He called the conduct outrageous and said he knew nothing about it.\\n\\n\"This behavior is not representative of me or my administration in any way,\" he said, \"and people will be held responsible for their actions.\"\\n\\nEven if he had nothing to do with the traffic snarls, the allegations could have serious consequences for Christie, analysts said.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED Did Christie know about traffic scandal?

He's going to have to find some way to defuse this to prove he doesn't run a shop like that,\" said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, a former adviser to several U.S. presidents.\\n\\nIt's a defining moment for Christie, CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said. And how he deals with the situation in the next two days -- from whether he fires anyone to what he says -- will be key.\\n\\n\"If he handles it decisively and then he sits down and calmly answers questions and doesn't berate the reporters who ask them, then he has a chance to be a leader who dealt with a crisis and he moves on,\" King said. \"But if that perception starts to stick in, that's not a presidential temperament. And that's bad for him nationally in his perspective. It's bad for him as he starts his new term in New Jersey. And it's bad for him with the audience he needs to care about most politically long-term at the moment, and that's the Republican base that he wants to make him their nominee.\"\\n\\nDoes this mean Christie's presidential ambitions are dashed?\\n\\n\"Not necessarily,\" Oxford University historian Timothy Stanley wrote in an opinion piece for CNN.com . \"He's a resourceful politician and it's still many months before campaigning starts in earnest. But now his opponents have a stick to beat him with. Best of all, it's an anti-government stick. If Republicans stand for anything right now, it's opposing the ability of government to mess with the individual's life -- and here we have a classic example of politicians taking revenge on each other at the expense of the average citizen.\"\\n\\nPolitical commentators from both sides of the aisle immediately recognized the potential for credibility questions, particularly around Christie's explanations in recent months about the traffic jams in Fort Lee and previous comments rejecting suggestions of political mischief.\\n\\n\"He's already cemented a narrative as something of a bully,\" said S.E. Cupp, a Republican political strategist and CNN \"Crossfire\" host. \"If this was happening in his administration, I don't think it would shocking.\"\\n\\nBut, she said, if it \"turns out he's lying about what he knew or whether he ordered it -- that's going to be the worst, the most damaging. Because his authenticity is his calling card.\"\\n\\nIt's important to ask how much Christie knew, Gergen said, but the reality might be more complicated.\\n\\n\"Sometimes the boss does not order something,\" Gergen said, describing the Nixon White House during the Watergate scandal. \"I don't know whether Nixon ordered Watergate, but I can guarantee you that people who carried out Watergate thought that's what he would have wanted. There's an environment in which you find yourself sometimes on staff when things don't have to be said. You sort of know.\"\\n\\n'Time for some traffic problems'\\n\\nThe correspondence, subpoenaed by Democrats investigating the matter and spiced with tough Jersey political talk and expletives, is the most damaging evidence so far supporting their assertions the move was orchestrated because Fort Lee's mayor, a Democrat, didn't endorse Christie's re-election.\\n\\nMayor Mark Sokolich said the traffic mess created serious hardships for commuters and other residents, and impacted public safety in his community.\\n\\nThe exchanges began three weeks before access lanes to the bridge were closed, causing heavy traffic backups between September 9 and 13, two months before Election Day.\\n\\n\"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\" Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's deputy chief of staff for legislative and intergovernmental affairs, said in an e-mail to David Wildstein, then the highest-level appointee representing the state at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge connecting the two states.\\n\\n\"Got it,\" Wildstein replied.\\n\\nIn another message about school buses with students onboard caught in the traffic jams, Wildstein writes, \"they are the children of Buono voters,\" apparently referring to Barbara Buono, Christie's Democratic opponent in last November's gubernatorial election.\\n\\nThose cited in the series of e-mails and text messages did not respond to requests for comment or to verify the communications.\\n\\nWildstein, who has left his job, is expected to appear at a legislative hearing on Thursday.\\n\\nDemocratic New Jersey Assembly Deputy Speaker John Wisniewski said the e-mails call into question the integrity of the governor's office.\\n\\nChristie, he said, \"has a lot of explaining to do.\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe the governor called the Port Authority and said, 'Close some lanes.' But I did say I hold him responsible for the atmosphere. Now finding that that atmosphere existed in his own office is what I find really troubling,\" Wisniewski said.\\n\\nJUST WATCHED E-mails tie Christie aides to gridlock Replay More Videos ...

But I'm beginning to question my judgment,\" Sokolich said.\\n\\nThe mayor raised the issue of public safety being compromised. A letter by his emergency services coordinator, Paul Favia, on September 10 obtained by CNN cited \"new traffic patterns\" around the bridge's toll plaza that were backing up traffic in Fort Lee.\\n\\n\"This new traffic pattern is causing unnecessary delays for emergency services to arrive on scene for medical emergencies,\" Favia said, citing one case in which paramedics rushing to aid an unconscious elderly woman suffering a heart attack were held up and had to meet the ambulance transporting the victim at the hospital instead of at the scene. She later died.\\n\\nDetails surrounding the woman's death haven't been released. But the situation could deepen Christie's political woes, Gergen said.\\n\\n\"If a woman died here,\" Gergen said, \"he's in deep, deep trouble.\"\\n\\nDemocrats swarm\\n\\nChristie is now campaigning for fellow GOP governors as chairman of the Republican Governors Association and is seen as prime political target for national Democrats.\\n\\nThey rarely attacked him during his re-election campaign but are now becoming more aggressive with the bridge controversy unfolding.\\n\\n\"These revelations are troubling for any public official, but they also indicate what we've come to expect from Governor Christie - when people oppose him, he exacts retribution. When people question him, he belittles and snidely jokes. And when anyone dares to look into his administration, he bullies and attacks,\" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chair, in a statement.\\n\\nA source close to Christie said \"there will probably be some sacrificial firing and that'll be it.\"   \n",

              "'LISTEN TO ARTICLE 5:37 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email\\nU.S. President Donald Trump is pushing his trade conflict with China toward a point where neither side can back down .\\nBy Aug. 30 , as the U.S. nears mid-term elections vital for Trump ’ s legislative agenda , the White House will be ready to impose 10 percent tariffs on $ 200 billion of Chinese-made products , ranging from clothing to television parts to refrigerators . The levies announced Tuesday -- together with some $ 50 billion already in the works -- stand to raise import prices on almost half of everything the U.S. buys from the Asian nation .\\nChina has seven weeks to make a deal or dig in and try to outlast the U.S. leader . President Xi Jinping , facing his own political pressures to look tough , has vowed to respond blow-for-blow . He ’ s already imposed retaliatory duties targeting Trump ’ s base including Iowa soybeans and Kentucky bourbon .\\nYet matching the latest U.S. barrage would force China to either levy much higher tariffs or take more disruptive steps like canceling purchase orders , encouraging consumer boycotts and putting up regulatory hurdles . Not only does that risk provoking Trump to follow through on threats to tax virtually all Chinese products , it could unleash nationalist sentiment on both sides that fuels a deeper struggle for geopolitical dominance .\\nTrump on Wednesday framed his trade actions as necessary to shield American businesses and farmers from harmful trading practices .\\n“ Other countries ’ trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses . I will open things up , better than ever before , but it can ’ t go too quickly , ” Trump said in a Twitter post from Brussels , where he ’ s attending a NATO summit . “ I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers , and will win ! ”\\n“ It ’ s already past the point of no return , ” said Pauline Loong , managing director at research firm Asia-Analytica in Hong Kong . “ What ’ s next is not so much a trade war or even a cold war as the dawn of an ice age in relations between China and the United States . ”\\nRead more on the escalating conflict Handbags and Cameras Hit as Trump Tariffs Target Consumers\\nYou Have a Month to Comment on Bull Semen , Vegetable Hair Tariff\\nTrump Must Meet Xi to Stop Trade War , Top House Republican Says\\nThose Cheap Chinese TVs ? They May Just Get a Lot More Expensive\\nStocks fell and commodities slid with emerging-market assets Wednesday as investors assessed the fallout . The S & P 500 Index ended the longest rally in a month and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated . While earlier tariffs were expected to have only a limited impact , economists warn a full-blown trade war could derail the strongest economic upswing in years .\\nThe Chinese Commerce Ministry said Tuesday that it would be forced to retaliate against what it called “ totally unacceptable ” U.S. tariffs . There have been no confirmed high-level talks between the two sides since an early June visit to Beijing by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that achieved no breakthroughs .\\nBeijing “ never yields to threat or blackmail ” and will retaliate against the “ groundless ” tariffs , China ’ s Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen said in written comments to ███ . “ The U.S. side ignored the progress , adopted unilateral and protectionist measures , and started the trade war . ”\\nWhat Our Economists Say ... “ As the targeted imports broaden to include more consumer products , a hit to household wallets and a bump to inflation could start to shift the political calculus in the U.S. , ” said ███ ’ s China economist Fielding Chen .\\nThe Aug. 30 date ensures the trade fight features prominently in November ’ s U.S. congressional elections , and the announcement exposed fissures between Trump and his Republican Party about the strategy . House Ways and Means Committee chief Kevin Brady , of Texas , warned of “ a long , multi-year trade war between the two largest economies in the world that engulfs more and more of the globe . ”\\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch , of Utah , called the new levies “ reckless ” and not “ targeted. ” Senator Chuck Grassley , a Republican from Iowa , said he had a “ great deal of concern ” about the trade spat with China and the level of uncertainty it ’ s creating among farmers and businesses in his state. “ When you don ’ t know what ’ s going to be the outcome , it ’ s very uncertain , and it ’ s had a definite impact , ” he told ███ Television . “ How long is this going to go on ? I hope we can settle pretty soon . ”\\nRead more : Some tariffs apply to flows that don ’ t exist\\nThe latest move suggests that Trump -- who in March declared that “ trade wars are good and easy to win ” -- may be compromising on his pledge to spare consumers from the pain . The tariffs could raise the prices of everything from baseball gloves to handbags to digital cameras just as voters are heading to the polls . Other high-profile items such as mobile phones have so far been spared .\\nThe U.S. felt it had no choice , but to move forward on the new tariffs after China failed to respond to the administration ’ s concerns over unfair trade practices and Beijing ’ s abuse of American intellectual property , according to two senior officials who spoke to reporters . The Trump administration has so far rejected Chinese offers to trim its massive trade surplus by buying more American goods , and is demanding more systemic change .\\n“ For over a year , the Trump administration has patiently urged China to stop its unfair practices , open its market , and engage in true market competition , ” Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement . “ China has not changed its behavior -- behavior that puts the future of the U.S. economy at risk . ”\\nAlthough the looming elections provide an immediate concern for Trump , a trade war poses a more existential concern for Xi , whose Communist Party has built its legitimacy on economic success . Prominent academics and some government officials have begun to question if China ’ s slowing , trade-dependent economy can withstand a sustained attack from Trump , which has already weighed heavily on stock prices .\\nAmong other things , the U.S. is asking China to roll back its “ Made-in-China 2025 ” program , a signature Xi initiative to dominate several strategic industries , such as semiconductors to aerospace development . Since abolishing presidential term limits , Xi has strengthened his control over the levers of power and money in China and can ’ t afford to look weak .\\n“ China is showing no signs of backing down and instead looks like it is preparing for a drawn out conflict , ” said Scott Kennedy , deputy director of China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington . “ China has a million and one ways to retaliate . ”\\n— With assistance by Jenny Leonard , Andrew Mayeda , Bryce Baschuk , and Kevin Cirilli'"

            "Sample Article Content:\n",
            "This happens for different reasons, but a key element is the vicious cycle between holding strong attitudes on an issue and something called “selective perception.” Essentially, the stronger your views are on an issue like Trump’s impeachment, the more likely you are to attend more carefully to information that supports your views and to ignore or disregard information that contradicts them. Consuming more belief-consistent information will, in turn, increase your original support or disapproval for impeachment, which just fortifies your attitudes. So, no, not much change will be seen in the minds of the 33 percent.\n",
            "\n",
            "Except, maybe. One of the more interesting findings from research on attitude change is that our more important, self-defining attitudes do not seem to change incrementally, a little at a time, but they can change dramatically, from one extreme to another. Typically, when others try to change our views on important issues that we hold firmly, their attempts to persuade us with facts and figures end up bolstering our original attitudes or pushing us out to even further extremes. But strong attitudes can experience what psychologists call “threshold-effect changes.” Over time, when we are exposed to information contradicting our attitudes, that information—even if we ignore, discount or deny it—can seep into our thinking and accumulate to a point where, across some threshold, people radically change their views to the opposite side of the spectrum. In other words, nothing much changes until everything changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "These jumps from one extreme attitude to another on self-defining issues are not uncommon, and have been seen with former skinheads turned tolerance trainers, peace activists turned violent militants, and religious zealots turned atheists. This type of drastic transformation is, of course, hard to predict, and it can be triggered by seemingly insignificant events (the tipping point for one skinhead was when his black co-worker tossed him half of his submarine sandwich when he had no lunch). But it typically occurs after repeated exposure to information contradicting their attitudes.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, yes, it is possible that if some of the testimonies in the hearings are experienced by true believers (at either extreme) as counter to their beliefs but also persuasive, this information can plant seeds of a different point of view, that might, someday, lead to a big change. Still, this is unlikely to happen very soon.\n",
            "\n",
            "Minds, however, can change among the vast majority of people who don’t hold extreme views. A recent study by the nonpartisan group More in Common found that about 67 percent of moderate Americans on both sides of the political divide—a group the authors of the study call “the exhausted majority”—are fed up with our current dysfunction, despise the contemptuous state of polarization we are in, and are eager to find ways to talk, compromise and work together again. These folks, particularly the 26 percent of moderates who are politically disengaged and thus are much less identified with either tribe, can be swayed. Of course, this assumes that they are not so burned out by the vitriol of our politics that they are unwilling to devote some attention to information coming out of the hearings.\n",
            "\n",
            "Research suggests a few basic strategies for changing minds that are, well, changeable. First, immediately establishing the credibility of the witnesses—to both progressives and conservatives —is paramount. For example, the introductions of the witnesses should emphasize their merits for both the left and the right to see. Second, logic and evidence can matter when they are clearly laid out, compelling and derived from trusted sources. Third, moving testimony by witnesses about the profound moral dilemmas they faced in coming forward, and any specific threats they experienced to their and their family’s physical safety, can help to humanize otherwise dry, technical testimony and move the listener. And finally, because most viewers tend to lean either red or blue (even though they are “exhausted”) and so will view the proceedings to some degree through their team’s lens, it is critical for the lawmakers to choose to emphasize just a few takeaway points, and then to stress the urgency and importance of the viewers’ attention to them. This can serve to move viewers from their more automatic, heuristic modes of cognitive processing to more intentional, systematic modes, where they will be more likely to take in new information and learn.\n",

            "But here is a caution for our leaders in Congress on both sides. Clearly, by many accounts, America is more polarized, anxious and exhausted by our political climate today than ever before. No, this is not all Congress’ doing, but many in Washington are playing their part. The resulting rise in the toxicity of our culture is such that today 86 percent of Americans are seriously concerned that our divisions will soon lead to violence.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, as our Republican and Democratic members of Congress prepare for the public hearings—ready themselves to make their case and score points and change minds—they should understand what is at stake. A narrow focus on short wins today can bring devastating outcomes tomorrow. Of course, members of Congress have a job to do to reveal the truth and share the facts with the American public. But our social fabric is stretched to the limit, and the future of our society, in the form of our basic capacities for compassion, connection and shared humanity across our divide, is on the line. The impeachment hearings’ primary audience—the 67 percent ( not base voters)—is persuadable through credibility, logic and evidence. This is a chance for lawmakers to plant seeds for changing minds in the future. So, please, for our nation’s sake, rise to your best selves.\n",
            "\n",
            "As someone who knew something about divisions once wrote, “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.” Come Wednesday, lawmakers will need to find a way to make their public case effectively, while not inflaming our already heightened sense of contempt and enmity for the other side. In the long run, this is all that will matter.\n",
