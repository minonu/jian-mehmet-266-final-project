gun policy expert spoke npr say could, so, would make dent. here look evidence: what research say two recent study provide evidence background check significantly curb gun violence. one, researcher found 1995 connecticut law requiring gun buyer get permit (which required background checks) associated 40 percent decline gun homicide 15 percent drop suicides. similarly, researcher studied missouri 2007 repeal permittopurchase law, found associated increase gun homicide 23 percent, well 16percent increase suicides. those huge result — one expert called missouri study strongest evidence background check really matter, new republic reported — lot socialscience research, there fuzziness result mean. one caveat study arent background check alone. instead, theyre permittopurchase laws, people go local law enforcement get permit and, therefore, background check. that difference might impacted results, explained daniel webster, coauthor studies. said forced get permit law enforcement might deter straw purchaser, example, getting check nearby store. furthermore, added many factor influence gun violence different ways, hard say much effect seen connecticut missouri would also happen states. addition, stand ground law enacted missouri 2007 may affected results. still, academic research point law effectiveness well. 2015 analysis study published course 15 years, webster coauthor garen wintemute found expanding background check could protective effect lethal violence, permittopurchase law particular help curb murder suicides. they also found background check help keep gun hand criminals, le certain whether turn lead le violence. there perfect consensus well backgroundcheck law work. 2000 study found 1994 brady act — instituted background check waiting period first — reduce either homicide suicide rates. a cdc task force also found 2003 review inconsistent finding whether restricting gun access background check work insufficient evidence whether array gun law effective. however, cdc also said finding didnt mean gun law dont work; rather, said needed study topic more. gunpolicy researcher say want better study background check (as well many policies), couple hurdle stand way. part problem good study effectiveness background check pretty rare, according webster. one reason hard find good test case study. there lot change variation [in laws] study recent times, said. vast majority law book many, many decades. another expert blamed federal government. one big problem fed funded good research area, said david hemenway, director harvard injury control research center expert firearmrelated injuries. he point federal restrictions, passed 1996, said center disease control could use funding advocate promote gun control. caused cdc back away gun research almost entirely. outside organization could pick slack, hemenway added, done so. foundation havent done good job, controversial area, said. dont want get involved. know things, dont know well would hope, given enormity problem. what recent shooting tell u while scholarly evidence suggests background check reduce crime, seeing evidence recent mass shooting tougher. new york time found december investigation, gun used many recent highprofile shooting purchased legally people passed background checks. importantly, though, extent backgroundcheck law book might prevented mass shootings, impossible compile similar list incident would occurred, laws. one thing recent shooting say current backgroundcheck system gaping hole it. example, fbi director james comey said july 2015 dylann roof, accused killing nine south carolina church last year, passed background check. information admission narcotic charge never reached fbi examiner handling check, washington post reported, roof able buy gun. in addition, state poor job submitting mental health record nics, politico kevin cirilli writes, allowing sick people obtain guns. cirilli point virginia tech shooter seunghui cho, history mental illness killed 32 people 2007. a stands, around 1.6 percent 148 million background check (that is, 2 million) 1994 2012 denied, according federal statistics. what statistic say one important question discussion impossible answer precisely: many gun obtained without background checks? arent exact number this, figure could still substantial. using 2004 data, around 18 percent gun transaction involved private sellers, buyer family member friend sources, washington post glenn kessler found last year. majority source licensed dealer (and therefore required conduct background checks). according figure cited kessler, 7 percent gun obtained gun show (and many sale probably underwent background checks). but data suggests gun show dont directly supply many gun used crimes. spokespeople national rifle association national shooting sport foundation, trade group gun sellers, also pointed npr government data showing le 1 percent prison inmate 1997 said got gun gun shows. meanwhile, nearly 80 percent obtained gun friends, family street (illegal) sources. all well may mean that, gunrights advocate like florida republican sen. marco rubio often point out, criminal simply obtain gun avenue stores. would mean background check dont deter people, and, therefore, expanding online private gun show sale would little. but possible conclusions. recent study offender chicago area found obtained gun personal connections, gun store theft. study suggested background check ineffective, one authors, duke university philip cook, disagrees. this research demonstrates current federal local regulation big effect availability gun criminal chicago, said release. cant buy gun stores, way people do, instead largely constrained making private deal acquaintances, may may willing able provide want. lawrence keane, general counsel national shooting sport foundation, told npr industry always supportive background check system, though also said doubt much good new proposal do. addition, group strongly opposed making background check universal. researcher hemenway webster think president executive action could modest effect gun violence. part, hemenway think universal background check would effective first step, think would fruitful long term innovation legislative action. in long run, spending lot money figuring technological fixes, said. easiest one make gun better home protection much, much le dangerous le likely stolen.",1,center,NPR Online News

(i think wrong that, that’s matter another day.) the timing march 4 podestamills email highly significant. if mill ever responded podesta’s question, email effect. unlikely mill would ignored podesta, particularly matter significance. thus, suspect discussion facetoface, phone, intermediaries. the timing march 4 podestamills email highly significant. date place three week podesta left white house job president’s top advisor order head clinton presidential campaign; transitioning podesta still involved oval office doings, clinton campaign running though yet publicly launched. significantly, email occurred administration campaign crisis mode: immediately new york time publicly exposed clinton’s private email system, house benghazi committee issued subpoena, demanding clinton preserve provide private email within scope committee’s investigation. advertisement advertisement advertisement with background, consider three salient matters. 1. obama’s concealment email clinton in day immediately times’ revelation mrs. clinton’s systematic use private email conduct government business, president obama sat interview claimed he’d learned clinton’s personal email use news reports” like everyone else. flatly denied personal knowledge matter. clearly, president lying american people: knew personally engaged several email clinton. extension, obama also lying congress. well knew, congressional committee investigating matter (most prominently, benghazi) communication obama clinton immense importance. now, know obama intimate personal awareness clinton doing; top white house advisor, podesta, aware concerned obamaclinton emails. did obama figure used alias, public congress would never find email clinton (and whomever else exchanging email using alias)? advertisement advertisement did president figure could quietly invoke executive privilege one would ever find email clinton? given obama manifestly determined conceal email clinton, chance would ever permitted prosecution clinton, would necessarily exposed emails? repeat i’ve arguing, i’d rate something le nonexistent. #share# 2. benghazi angle we know evening march 4, podesta emailed mills, matter greatest concern fledgling clinton campaign house benghazi committee’s subpoena former secretary clinton’s private emails. podesta contacted her, mill received email robby mook, clinton campaign manager. discussion among clinton operative whether state department would release email clinton turned (i.e., 30,000 surrendered, 33,000 withheld would soon undertake destroy). mook thus wanted clarity” whether house subpoena libya, right?” mill replied right.” did president figure used alias, public congress would never find emails? in midst discussion subpoena, mill received podesta’s message obamaclinton email — halfhour responded mook. given house subpoena frontandcenter time, one must ask whether podesta concerned possible connection obamaclinton email benghazi. sure, necessarily case. clinton camp obama white house also dealing overarching problem handle email mess general. obamaclinton email going problem white house clinton campaign, benghazirelated emails. still, benghazi question must asked. among central benghazi issue whether obamaclinton communication occurred and, so, about. example, white house first deny obama contact clinton night terrorist attack when, fact, two spoken phone around 10 p.m.? connection call statement secretary clinton, issued almost simultaneously, blamed antimuslim video (rather alqaeda affiliated jihadists) attack? advertisement to day, obamaclinton email made public. quite apart question president secretary state communicating highlevel policy matter private, nonsecure channel, remains question whether email communication related benghazi — appalling lack security attack, disgraceful lack military response attack, cynical blame video” coverup attack. 3. obama justice department fbi ignore destroy cheryl mills’s email advertisement let’s place podesta email (with mill clinton campaign operatives) broader context. occur right public revelation clinton homebrew server house subpoena. occurred midst know communication mill platte river networks, contractor servicing clinton server. late march, paul combetta, prn technician mill touch, deleted undertook destroy email clinton’s server — including 33,000 clinton never provided state department, falsely claimed involved personal matter contained classified information. at minimum, podesta email demonstrate that, clinton’s homebrew system revealed, reaction among obamaclinton operative stunned disbelief. conduct was, instead, one would expect people well aware clinton’s email situation, understood mission control damage minimize disclosure. stateofmind evidence would crucial prosecution clinton confederate mishandling classified information, destroying government files, obstruction justice. when clinton’s homebrew system revealed, reaction among obamaclinton operative stunned disbelief. since obviously case, would even obviously case fbi agent prosecutor working clinton email investigation, earth would justice department make deal cheryl mill prevented fbi examining email critical march 2015 time frame? consider one small example: noted above, appear mill replied writing podesta’s march 4 email concealing obamaclinton emails. mill email others clinton camp matter? we’ll probably never know. justice department agreed fbi would examine anything mills’s laptop computer postdating january 31, 2015 and, unbelievably, fbi would destroy laptop limited examination. advertisement advertisement why would justice department grant mill immunity prosecution negotiate severe restriction fbi’s ability review preserve email exchange access mills’s laptop computer? all, could forced mill produce laptop, without making accommodations, simply issuing grandjury subpoena. and why, mill asked received immunity prosecution conduct, would justice department fbi permit sit — lawyer — clinton’s fbi interview, decision flouted ethical rule federal law would also damaged case clinton indictment? #related#try theory: since president obama used alias discus sensitive matter clinton’s private, nonsecure email system, falsely denied knowledge system, decided conceal email clinton public, justice department knew one ever going prosecuted anyway. justice department fbi could rationalize cutting otherwise inexplicable deal would never cut case actually trying make knew going case — mills, clinton, anyone.",2,right,National Review
