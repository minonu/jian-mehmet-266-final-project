(the australian later told fbi, led bureau open investigation.) in case, papadopoulos arrested last summer making false statement fbi investigators, cut plea deal, began cooperating investigators. whatever tip, mueller likely know it. 2) trump tower meeting: june 3, 2016 — little month papadopoulos’s tip, still news broke democrat hacked — publicist rob goldstone emailed acquaintance his, donald trump jr. goldstone described news client ara emin agalarov, fatherson pair real estate developer who’d done business trumps: the crown prosecutor russia met father ara morning meeting offered provide trump campaign official document information would incriminate hillary dealing russia would useful father. obviously high level sensitive information part russia government’s support mr. trump helped along ara emin. don jr. enthusiastically accepted offer, goldstone arranged meeting six day later, june 9. trump delegation included jr., paul manafort, jared kushner. met goldstone, russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya, agalarov company executive ike kaveladze, russianamerican lobbyist rinat akhmetshin, translator anatoli samochornov. once existence meeting became public, party involved claimed dud, resulting nothing consequence. timing meeting strange. three day later, assange announced he’d received email related hillary clinton. two day that, dnc announced hacked blamed russia. goldstone saw article emailed emin kaveladze, writing news eerily weird” considering they’d discussed trump tower meeting. guccifer 2.0 began posting day that. 3) cambridge analytica ceo’s contact wikileaks: cambridge analytica steve bannontied firm digital work trump campaign news late. and last year, learned cambridge’s ceo, alexander nix, twice contacted wikileaks topic hacked emails. nix say early june,” learned assange’s claim hillary clintonrelated emails, reached julian assange ask advance look emails. say assange turned down. then august, assange posted dnc emails, nix emailed cambridge employee say he’d recently reached assange again, offering help organizing dnc material wikileaks. said hadn’t yet heard back. nix assange said overture didn’t go anywhere. 4) donald trump jr.’s contact wikileaks: then, separately, donald trump jr. communication wikileaks group’s twitter account toward end campaign. a best know, wikileaks began communication, dming jr. tell guessed password new pac run antitrump site,” putintrump.org, launch. comments?” group asked. trump jr. answered: record don’t know i’ll ask around. thanks.” then october 3, 2016, wikileaks dmed jr. again, asking comment on” push” story hillary clinton said wanted drone” assange. jr. answered, already earlier today. it’s amazing get away with.” he followed question: what’s behind wednesday leak keep reading about?” height chatter wikileaks major batch anticlinton material ready. however, indication wikileaks answered question jr. gave advance information podesta’s email coming. group sent couple messages, known response jr. 5) roger stone’s several contact guccifer 2.0 wikileaks: roger stone longtime republican operative reputation dirty trick decadeslong relationship donald trump. stone official trump campaign adviser briefly, departing operation early august 2015 clashing staffers. remained trump’s orbit and, extent, communication candidate afterward. both public private, stone fixated hackings leaks. one associate stone’s claimed washington post point spring 2016, news hackings broke, stone said he’d learned julian assange wikileaks obtained email would hurt democrats. (stone denies this.) the initial leak guccifer 2.0 wikileaks posted june july. august 4, stone emailed fellow extrump adviser longtime associate sam nunberg: dined julian assange last night,” according wall street journal. (stone say joke flight record prove wasn’t london then.) the day email, august 5, stone penned breitbart article took guccifer’s story lone hacker stole dnc email face value argued russia probably wasn’t responsible. also tweeted julian assange hero.” three day later, august 8, stone started publicly claiming inside information. actually communicated assange,” said. believe next tranche document pertain clinton foundation there’s telling october surprise may be.” a day that, stone began tweeting at, eventually dming with, guccifer 2.0 (who, again, reportedly identified russian intelligence officer). dm later leaked, leading stone post claimed full exchange. posted message mainly friendly chitchat particularly substantive. on august 21, stone tweeted odd prediction: trust me, soon podesta’s time barrel. #crookedhillary.” many would later point — came month podesta email became public — ask whether stone advance knowledge podesta email leak. (stone would later claim since came midst scandal surrounding stone’s old friend paul manafort’s ukraine work, merely predicting podesta’s business dealing would exposed.”) a october began, stone took new role — wikileaks’ hype man. claimed inside knowledge, saying friend” met assange learned mother lode coming wednesday.” tweeted: wednesday @hillaryclinton done. #wikileaks.” nothing came wednesday, stone tweeted, libs thinking assange stand wishful thinking. payload coming. #lockthemup.” assange published podesta email two day later. immediately, question whether garrulous operative involved, eventually spurred wikileaks tweet group never communicated roger stone.” atlantic later reported stone dmed wikileaks twitter account afterward, complaining attacking” him. false claim association used democrat undermine impact publications,” wikileaks responded. don’t go don’t want u correct you.” stone shot back: ha! ‘correct’ people think you’re lying. operation leak like sieve. need figure friend are.” what make this? stone obviously contact two key leakers, public statement show one point wanted people think inside line wikileaks’ plans. however, he’s repeatedly denied inside knowledge involvement, haven’t seen clear evidence truly knowledge. in case, might learn mueller’s probe soon enough. want testify roger,” sam nunberg said year, referring special counsel’s team. want say roger going around telling people colluding julian assange.” 6) peter smith’s hunt hillary’s deleted emails: last certainly least, one emailrelated subplot 2016 campaign — it’s weird one. this one involves separate set emails: word got hillary clinton used personal email account work state department, agreed hand workrelated email account government investigators. turned previously deemed 32,000 email (about half total) personal” rather workrelated, deleted them. conservative like longtime republican operative peter smith didn’t take clinton’s explanation deleted email face value questioned whether could contained scandalous behavior criminal evidence. number included gop presidential nominee donald trump. russia, you’re listening, hope you’re able find 30,000 [hillary clinton] email missing,” trump said july 27, 2016, press conference. think probably rewarded mightily press. let’s see happens. next.” it around time smith began unusual project. assumed clinton’s email server hacked email must somewhere, dark web.” reached computer expert conservative activists, hoping assemble team would track emails. smith didn’t work trump campaign. said repeatedly claimed contact michael flynn, advising trump. one recruiting document smith sent cybersecurity expert matt tait contained subheader trump campaign (in coordination extent permitted independent expenditure).” listed several names: steve bannon, kellyanne conway, sam clovis, flynn, lisa nelson. (bannon conway denied involvement. three haven’t commented.) eventually, smith gave version happened wall street journal’s shane harris. said team found five hacker group said clinton’s emails, two seemed russian. knew people probably around russian government,” smith said. however, went on, couldn’t determine whether email authentic, ended advising hacker give wikileaks. email ever surfaced. smith — 81 year old poor health — killed may 2017, 10 day speaking harris. smith’s effort appears failed. smith admitted tried get stolen document group understood russian governmenttied. question michael flynn’s role — particularly since, per harris’s sources, intelligence report say russian hacker discussed could get leaked email flynn’s hands. much remains murky situation, flynn cooperating mueller’s team part plea deal, special counsel likely know whatever does. mueller likely bring charge email hacking matter. whom? last november, wall street journal’s aruna viswanatha del quentin wilber reported justice department identified six russian government official involved dnc hack considering bringing charges. interestingly, though, report claimed special counsel robert mueller chosen take dnc hack investigation relatively technical” already way nearly year.” that appears since changed. nbc news daily beast reported march mueller taken charge email hacking investigation. washington post reported january mueller added veteran cyber prosecutor,” ryan dickey, team. (credit marcy wheeler flagging point.) so it’s pretty safe bet mueller bring charge related email hackings. judging past indictments, he’ll also use tell story exactly happened, extent can. is, all, good deal still don’t know — instance, how, exactly, dnc podesta email get hacker wikileaks? it’s important remember know — could still public. certainly possible several contact real purported leaker hacker listed went nowhere, it’s bit harder believe six separate contact resulted nothing consequence. mueller already gotten three people tied trump plead guilty cooperate investigation. getting george papadopoulos, got earliest known tip russian hacked emails? getting michael flynn, may tied peter smith’s effort get clinton email russian hackers? getting rick gates, paul manafort’s righthand man campaign? all three men pleaded guilty, haven’t seen fruit cooperation yet. may providing mueller information hacked emails, may not. it’s safe say they’re telling mueller good deal that’s interest — eventually, find what.",0,left,Vox,2018

people work less, turn raise official poverty rate. certain programs, unemployment insurance, may effect individual (although evidence suggests effect large), bruce meyer dan rosenbaum nada eissa

currently, state required redraw political boundary based census’s official count total population every 10 years, includes minor noncitizen immigrants. texas plaintiff argue state allowed apportion seat based u.s. citizen 18 year age live. it seems like minor detail, it’s actually major distinction. decennial census doesn’t track citizenship data, census’s american community survey does. although 435 u.s. congressional district roughly equal total populations, number eligible voter rate actual participation vary wildly place place. for example, florida’s 11th district, home largely white retirement mecca villages, 81 percent resident adult citizens. california’s heavily latino 34th district, anchored downtown los angeles, 41 percent resident eligible vote. variation across district term actual turnout even eyepopping. according result compiled polidata cook political report, montana’s lone house district cast 483,932 vote president 2012, four time tally texas’s 29th district, 114,901. a move toward counting eligible voters, logistically difficult may be, would drastically shift political power away urban environs minority noncitizens, toward whiter area larger nativeborn populations. that’s bad news democrats: 50 congressional district lowest share eligible voters, 41 occupied democrat (nearly latinomajority seats). meanwhile, 50 district highest share eligible voters, 38 represented gop. most legal scholar skeptical case change way house seat electoral college vote apportioned state every 10 years; all, constitution pretty clearly reference role census’s population count process. but let’s lay hypothetical minute. would happen count voter rather people used reapportionment (allotting seat among states) redistricting (drawing boundary within states)?

"house democrats’ internal feud prescription drug prices, explained",2019-06-17,"the united state highest prescription drug price world, summer, democratic house leadership unveil plan fix — though question remain effective measure be. reducing prescription drug price key plank house democrats’ platform 2018 midterms. six month term, however, concrete bill yet emerge house leadership subject, early excerpt speaker nancy pelosi floated spurred progressive concern. curbing rise prescription drug price problem democrat wanted solve time. way industry currently regulated, many pharmaceutical company established monopoly certain drug significant leeway come determining cost medications. a result, u boast highest prescription drug price developed country, leading shocking cost thousand drug including insulin. recently, gene therapy treatment novartis priced whopping $2.1 million. despite democrats’ consensus problem broad way solve (more government regulation), there’s disagreement among lawmaker best route take. although pelosi’s bill yet finalized, laid general outline various caucus meetings, including recent update responded progressive pushback: according piece she’s revealed far, bill would enable health human service secretary alex azar negotiate prescription drug covered medicare, final price would decided government accountability office agreement could initially reached. that approach differs significantly two bills, one introduced rep. ro khanna (dca) sen. bernie sander (ivt), rep. lloyd doggett (dtx) sen. sherrod brown (doh). doggett brown’s legislation, garnered support congressional progressive caucus, would include gao middleman negotiations. additionally, would enable pharmaceutical company’s competitor produce generic version drug firm engage negotiation fairly. a key difference democrats’ option — involving third party negotiations, even it’s government body — point contention, due concern added step might make process clunkier, also limiting potential price reductions. to top off, progressive argue process developing bill opaque — although they’ve heartened latest tweak house leadership, politico reports. according senior democratic aide, head two major committee jurisdiction legislation making round different democratic constituency try flesh proposal. we need type transparency writing drug pricing legislation pricing drugs,” doggett told vox statement. a lawmaker await final version bill spearheaded pelosi, still outstanding question whether ambitious enough. the hhs secretary isn’t currently allowed negotiate prescription price directly house democrats’ legislation, whatever form wind taking, intended address major problem see way prescription drug negotiation work. under current law, hhs secretary barred directly negotiating price prescription drug covered medicare, arrangement established 2003 part medicare modernization act set medicare’s prescription drug benefit. presently, private plan offer medicare part benefit negotiate drug cost independently. often lack leverage secure kind reduction government may able obtain, given bargaining power. proponent changing system argue federal government could significantly sway directly involved pricing discussions, especially medicare beneficiary represent roughly third prescription drug expenditure annual basis. point department veteran affairs, negotiates prescription drug price retired active troop u military, able obtain medicine major discount compared rest market. pharmaceutical company counter drug price reflect high cost research development go producing groundbreaking medicines. and, historically, republican argued government shouldn’t get involved determining price anyway. in 2016, however, president donald trump signaled interested changing 2003 law well. time, trump argued government needed get involved reducing prescription drug prices, stance gop previously pushed against. because trump’s position, pelosi repeatedly suggested issue one area democrat could potentially work get legislation congress. successful, it’s something democrat president could tout substantive bipartisan achievement. what know pelosi bill — two big reason it’s raised progressive ire at moment, final version pelosi bill still flux, though official rollout expected coming months. huffpost’s zach carter daniel marans previously reported, contour proposal described caucus meeting late may spurred outcry progressive argued legislation didn’t go far enough hold pharmaceutical company accountable. pelosi recently signaled making update proposal response critique it’s received, hill’s peter sullivan reports. here’s know speaker’s plan far, though piece finalized: it would enable hhs secretary azar negotiate pharmaceutical company price drug covered medicare. if company hhs able reach agreement, government accountability office — independent agency conduct research advises congress — would help set final price. (this different binding arbitration process proposed house speaker earlier version measure.) a reference point pricesetting, gao would use median pricing particular drug country around world. the plan calling negotiation target roughly 250 drugs, though cap number drug would part negotiations. if company comply negotiation particular drug, would penalized excise tax 50 percent sale drug previous year. while gao seen better option thirdparty private arbiter (something floated prior talks) critic leadership plan, there’s lot unanswered question exactly body would handle job. gao usually tasked delivering oversight report government activities, managing government negotiations. if gao provided resource construct inhouse unit this, that’s definitely possible,” say rachel sachs, law professor washington university st. louis. george mason university health policy professor len nichols agreed gao certainly capable,” though noted guidance health economist would crucial. the role gao could potentially play part proposal that’s prompted questions, however. the idea drug minimum also emerged another point contention. previously, pelosi suggested 25drug floor, though speaker since said plan would aim target 250 drugs. critic expressed worry number set legislation would instead become de facto maximum, negotiation would peter agreement reached select number drugs. advocate favor establishing drug floor suggest would force hhs secretary engage negotiation set list drugs, least, note specific group drug account high proportion spending. data show congress focus medicare price negotiation key drug reason willie sutton robbed banks; that’s money is,” said ben wakana, executive director patient affordable drug statement. expert subject also note prescription drug negotiation would likely tested smaller pool effort could effectively implemented broadly. the discussion around trying limited amount drug start with, figure infrastructure needed it’s going work,” university pittsburgh health policy professor walid gellad tell vox. even proponent idea aren’t limited numerical fashion would agree prioritization important. won’t possible administration negotiate drug first year,” say sachs. progressive also worried pharma accountability beyond mechanic negotiations, one progressives’ biggest concern whether bill adequate backstop ding company financial penalty don’t comply process. pelosi’s proposal safeguards, huffpost reports: company refused participate would slapped tax equal 50 percent prior year’s sale drug. price drug covered medicare part b could increased going forward, company still would 100% price hike taxed away. doggett’s bill, however, 100 cosponsors, take much aggressive tack matter. if company treat negotiation fairly, doggett’s bill would enable hhs issue license competitor would able produce drug generic, effectively eliminating company’s monopoly particular drug. this approach would push company approach negotiation around drug pricing seriously — make sure patient could still access particular drug even company manufacturing opted negotiations. it’s difference policy a case many clash progressive house leadership, tension recent month fueled process behind legislation’s rollout. many progressive previously said felt like there’s startling lack communication bill developed. people included,” congressional progressive caucus cochair mark pocan (dwi) told politico’s adam cancryn early june. process now.” house leadership seemingly taking progressive feedback account, however. past week, pelosi’s decision target roughly 250 drug evidence that, it’s move that’s since heralded cpc cochair rep. pramila jayapal (dwa), politico reports. leadership committee jurisdiction continue solicit feedback incorporate idea across caucus order develop strongest, boldest possible legislation lower prescription drug price americans,” pelosi spokesperson henry connelly told vox. democratic leadership also talk staffer white house months, given trump’s interest working issue. make confusing optics, expert argue collaboration vital getting anything passed signed law. senior democratic aide told vox conversation white house focus subject simply discussion negotiations. still, openness working alongside trump issue — even administration flagrantly obstructs democratic effort investigation — prompted left question whether even capacity reliable partner. let’s live promise go small attempt satisfy president cannot satisfied,” doggett said. trump’s recent tantrum infrastructure, seems unlikely count purported administration legislative endorsement.” the future bill air reducing prescription drug price — much like tackling surprise medical bill — issue widespread voter support, make likely something could actually make divided congress. according 2018 poll kaiser family foundation, 96 percent democrat support giving government ability negotiate directly order reduce drug price medicare, 92 percent republican feel same. bringing drug price would clear political victory lawmaker side aisle. trump’s interest working issue provided republican cover back away historic position protecting pharmaceutical business interests, say brendan buck, partner blue engine media, previously advised former house speaker paul ryan. the president totally shuffled politics issue way that’s pretty remarkable,” told vox. new willingness republican take drug company didn’t exist five year ago.” buck added, however, white house support bill may enough win senate republicans. i caution idea [democrats] work white house, unreliability, senate care lot this,” said, adding, outcome drug pricing progressive caucus endorse mitch mcconnell put floor.” that tension repeatedly put house democratic leader tough spot, could ultimately evident whatever bill speaker finally unveils. on one hand, democratic leader interested securing bipartisan win, could mean bill concession trump republican accept, according huffpost. other, progressive activist lawmaker pushing proposal would send strong message drug pricing, though legislation may become law soon. with current configuration senate, you’re going get legislation that’s aggressive enough make lot people happy democratic side,” nichols said. don’t think we’re talking legislation actually pas senate.” other smaller reform — like creates act, target tactic pharmaceutical company use deter competition, recently passed house — appear still chance, however. given context, progressive wondering democratic leader don’t push

migration isn’t turning red state blue,2014-08-29,"last week, new york times’s robert gebeloff david leonhardt published article, growing bluestate diaspora,” made case transplant blue state making red state purple. pattern played important role helping democratic party win last two presidential election four last six,” wrote. it’s fascinating hypothesis, it’s overstated, view. first problem predominant political trend past two decade consistently better performance democrats, instead greater polarization across partisan geographic lines. remember, gop control house representatives, plurality state legislature majority governor’s mansions, republican slight favorite take senate november. democrat done well recent presidential elections, republican take senate hold house, 2016 gop control senate 12.5 past 24 year house 18 24. we’re saying we’d rather republicans’ hand play. balance power country reasonably equivocal, tends long run. by contrast, trend toward greater polarization clear sweeping. it’s clear race house; far fewer swing district were, even accounting effect gerrymandering. it’s clear gubernatorial races, bear much stronger correlation presidential election race federal office. it’s clear race presidency. 1992, democrat bill clinton beat republican george h.w. bush, state — none — either candidate 20 percentage points. 2012, 18 them, 11 republican mitt romney. state (such west virginia colorado) switched party loyalties, part, red state gotten redder blue state gotten bluer; theory role played migration need reconcile evidence. but present challenge. might seem follow there’s mixing american across state lines, everything might converge shade political purple. seen opposite pattern instead? one part answer straightforward: interstate migration increasing. instead, downward trend since 1980s; fewer american (as share population) relocating across state line couple decade ago. the part little complicated. people leave area don’t necessarily resemble one stay. instead, there’s evidence migrants’ political belief mirror voter new destination. many people moving liberal state conservative state may conservative, may least end way long. people moving conservative state liberal state may liberal. of course, certain state attract certain type voter job opportunity change — north carolina’s research triangle, instance. time noted, number red state (such idaho south carolina) home many blue state transplant yet continue vote reliably republican. there’s little sign that’s changing. if anything, mover generally extreme political view natives: people moving west coast new england, example, liberal people grew there. thus, process intracountry migration could contributing political polarization rather making state purple. we get sense general social survey, national biannual poll conducted university chicago. g asks respondent rate liberal conservative. g also asks census division respondent live in, lived 16 year old. using g data, figure percentage people consider liberal among different groups: longterm residents: people lived region 16 remain now; former residents: people lived region 16 live different one now; new residents: people live region didn’t 16. this method imperfect: census division don’t overlay perfectly political regions, g doesn’t drill state level. also, although we’ve gathered data version g since 2004, sample size aren’t huge. still, data enough suggest people moving away region ideologically distinct continue live there. example, people moved away south atlantic region (which includes number fairly conservative states) liberal people moved away new england regions. despite fact 22 percent people stayed south atlantic division consider liberal, compared 27 percent american overall. instead, mover common new neighbors; liberal attracted liberal regions, conservative conservative regions. next plot shows, politics longterm resident correlate reasonably well politics new residents. the relationship isn’t perfect (the correlation coefficient .62), trend reasonably clear. example, middle atlantic pacific division relatively liberal longterm resident relatively liberal new residents; west south central east south central division conservative longterm resident conservative new residents. new england make interesting case: may migrant made region blue. whereas 26 percent people born stayed new england describe liberal — national average — 49 percent migrated do. may samplesize fluke (new england smallest population census division therefore largest margin error). still, make sense given much bluer new england become. vermont reliably republican state. outside new england, importance migration reshaping political coalition may fairly minimal. people live region grew up, we’ve mentioned, move tend adopt politics new home (or they’ve politics along). in census division new england, percentage liberal among native resident within point two among resident (after accounting move away division). factor may responsible changing tone redblue political map. still, extent migration mattered, probably contributing political polarization rather blurring country shade purple. fit idea proposed book big sort”: people increasingly living near politically likeminded. 18yearold south carolina might go college boston liberal political leaning stay south carolina she’s conservative. pattern selfreinforcing. liberal resident likely leave south carolina, mean higher percentage one remain conservatives. the big sort” hypothesis problems; it’s unclear causality works, example. 18yearold become liberal get california, inclined move california already liberal?

why economics minimum wage increase tough measure,2019-09-30,"advertisement last week, several researcher federal reserve posted analysis minimum wage new york state. grand sweep research debate done minimum wage, blog post dispute kicked minor blips. microcosm grander debate, actually rather instructive. basically, trio researcher federal reserve branch new york spotted chance natural experiment. last years, new york state passed series minimum wage hike gradually phasing in: threeyear hike tipped workers, started 2013, $7.25 $9.00 hour; 2015 law raise fast food worker $15 hour 2021; 2016 law raise whole state $15 hour 2022. meanwhile, neighboring pennsylvania remains federal minimum wage $7.25 hour. since effect minimum wage job hotly contested — critic contend raise pay cost le employment — look county lie either side new yorkpennsylvania border, see performed? minimum wage hike harm employment, show comparison. the researcher wound looking two sector 2010 2018 — retail, leisure hospitality — across 10 new york county 9 pennsylvania counties. found earnings grew faster new york side. since minimum wage going up, thats surprising. whats important that, retail declining everywhere, set county declined essentially rate. meanwhile, leisure hospitality employment grew rate. essentially, found zero employment effect. (graph courtesy federal reserve bank new york.) it didnt take long conservativeleaning think tank, empire center, post critique fed analysis. the logic focusing county either side border that, right next other, presumably share similar regional economies. chance youre comparing apple orange — analysis thrown random event confounding variable — minimized. fed researcher sort assumed, well, border area theyre similar, e.j. mcmahon, founder research director empire center, told week. theyre actually similar, theyre different regional economies. specifically, mcmahon pointed two casino opened sullivan tioga county new york side. argued casino unusual enough business model — statelicensed gambling — including job create analysis minimum wage obscures reveals. also pointed fed inclusion orange county new york side problematic: exurb new york city, commuter city live there, integrated greater metro area public transit. county study rural, one widely agreed upon point minimum wage debate policy effects, whatever are, going different lowcostofliving rural area expensive urban ones. mcmahon also argued new york side bigger population economically dynamic across board. mcmahon reran number 2013 2018, removed sullivan, tioga, orange counties. found leisure hospitality job new york side grew slower pennsylvania side: 2 percent versus 4.5 percent, respectively. (graph courtesy empire center.) this thing get murky involved. mcmahon wasnt presenting analysis true correct one — merely demonstrating question whats best applestoapples comparison profoundly change result. public discourse often treat analysis like objective relatively unique way, end definitive numbers. analytical plumbing produce number inevitably involves lot subjective judgment calls. when week spoke fed researchers, didnt find mcmahons logic crazy. (in fact, side spoke well others professionalism interviews.) disagreed. dont think inappropriate include orange county, jason bram, one researchers, said. yes, technically part new york metro area, urban erie county pennsylvania side. since casino openings, business decision involved, occurred period wage hikes, felt proper include well. fact theyre opening hotel number year ratcheting minimum wage, dont think thats something want ignore, bram continued. casinos, there also question whether knock entire county, whether simply realize spike end graph above, job growth new york side (the blue line) outpaces pennsylvania side (in red), probably artifact casino openings. you also take logic opposite direction: three county one knock out, more? pike county, pennsylvania side, distant exurb new york city, still exurb. erie county, far west end pennsylvania counties, account bulk job side, rustbelt industrial community others. remove pike erie equation, job growth pennsylvania side fall 3.5 percent 2013 2018. thats still 2 percent mcmahon found new york side; put tioga sullivan county (the one casinos) back in, new york rise 9 percent. remove orange pike, new york 9 percent pennsylvania 3.1 percent. remove erie, sullivan, tioga, 4.4 percent new york 6.7 percent pennsylvania. which version best version natural experiment? knows. starting remove county one considering small number county begin slippery slope, arindrajit dube, another economist who done wellregarded work minimum wage, told week. better recognize limitation single case study instead consider one additional data point rather sizable growing minimum wage literature. words, natural experiment perfect, better approach find many natural experiment possible, see pattern converges. in respect, worth noting dube involved comprehensive research regard. recent study coauthored, looking local result 130 minimum wage hike last three decade more, found fall job paying le new minimum wage fully offset jump new job paying it, washington post summarized it. dube also pointed another recent study, focusing 51 natural experiment since 2007 — also looked particularly rural area featured increase comparable disruption wed get national hike $15 hour. again, found discernible effect employment. meanwhile, recent overview congressional budget office concluded national $15 hour minimum wage would cause anything zero 3.7 million job losses. of course, thats big picture across whole country. local level, enormous potential variation. beyond that, everyones moral prior minimum wage pretty strong. moral focus preserving freedom business owners, higher wage workers? latter, much risk tolerate minimum wage hikes? interpret overall pattern study result light theory, say aggressive minimum wage hike natural experiment far provide? then there one final point mcmahon made, fed study might play politics. fed researcher clearly intended post interesting, admittedly crude, intellectual exercise — one might hopefully turn far sophisticated comprehensive study future. mcmahon worried qualification would get flattened study treated wider discourse. instead acknowledgement analysis one imperfect data point among many, itll federal reserve say minimum wage make difference, said. thing could half life easily decade. how economic researcher calculate release work public consumption difficult question. weve entered strange new era everything crude working paper finely polished peerreviewed study get picked reporters, scribblers, activists, politicians. rest u discourse definitely responsibility try put thing context. i strong opinion minimum wage policy myself. consider column least one effort meet responsibility. want essential commentary analysis like delivered straight inbox? sign week today best article newsletter here.",1,center,The Week - News,2019

(however, year, first time, party letting outofstate member military participate web, democrat making allowance iowan might trouble showing up.) the caucus administered separately major party, republican democrat quite different rules. year, gop contest simple: opening rigmarole caucus sites, ordinary secret ballot vote presidential candidate conducted, total tallied statewide. it kind like carnival, candidate supporter say, come us! the democratic caucus far complicated — theyre rowdy, hourslong public affairs, backandforth debate among attendee go physically stand supporter preferred candidate. kind like carnival, candidate supporter say, come us, group! say drake university political scientist dennis goldford. there secret ballot, democratic candidate doesnt get enough supporter precinct (15 percent attendees), eliminated, reality show style. here video showing one precinct caucus went 2008: 2) care win iowa caucuses? like not, iowa result appear hugely important determining major parties’ presidential nominee — particularly considered alongside impact fellow early state new hampshire. it’s remotely national primary. national poll mean nothing. nation isnt voting, say stevens. instead, iowan get first say. every winner competitive major party presidential nomination contest since 1980 except one started winning iowa caucuses, new hampshire primary, both. both recent president — barack obama george w. bush — kicked primary season winning iowa (and survived subsequent loss new hampshire). and, importantly, even iowa victor doesn’t end winning nomination end, state’s result dramatically shake presidential contest — knocking candidate race entirely, elevating others toptier status eye political elite future voters. you think number people participate — usually little 100,000 people per party, meaning around 20 percent eligible caucusgoers — iowa amazing, outsize impact country, say democratic pollster stan greenberg. 3) why, exactly, smalltime contest affect larger race much? like i, political world obsessed question actually win presidential nomination race. large part world come believe caucus outcome help shed important light question. (remember, iowa, assessment win mainly based poll — polls, course, wrong.) iowa amazing, outsize impact country it pretty weird: essentially, iowa caucus important media, candidates, political world broadly treat result greatly important determining win. play several interacting ways: the medium hype iowa results, branding candidate winner loser based performed there. winner get ton excited coverage, loser become afterthoughts. and, particularly multicandidate fields, winning medium coverage hugely important. donor activists, too, look iowa result judge whether candidate they’re supporting still viable. poor iowa performance likely mean fewer campaign donation endorsements, make difficult candidate stay race. voter state — especially trying make sense complex, multicandidate field — take iowa result (and medium coverage results) cue contender actually win. there’s better evidence win won, say longtime democratic pollster mark mellman. accordingly, poll result state change incredibly quickly iowa result sink in. caucus, across country people paying attention margins, say john norris, who organized several democratic candidates. candidate naturally take account, many invest huge amount time money try well iowa. result come in, candidate poorly often take hint quit race (spurred donor longer fund campaigns, medium outlet longer cover them, subsequent poll showing they’re performing poorly elsewhere). shrinking field process known winnowing. amplify other: behavior candidate assures medium caucus result really important, justifies even coverage iowa. it’s symbiotic relationship, say goldford. long candidate think caucus important, press think caucus important. vice versa. all dynamics, noted, also apply new hampshire (and, decreasing degree, state process continues). media, candidates, political elites, certain extent voter elsewhere act signal believe iowa new hampshire sending them. thats early state contest dramatically reshape nomination landscape long vast majority american people get weigh in. 4) thats pretty abstract. could give example iowa shaken past contests? the earliest case iowa changed everything littleknown former georgia gov. jimmy carter victory 1976 democratic caucuses. second time iowa went first, carter calculated there, hed get much medium coverage hed catapulted obscurity national fame. essentially camped iowa year, strategy worked like charm won. carter subsequent mediadriven poll surge helped narrowly carry new hampshire 11 next 12 contests, followed nomination white house. jimmy carter would say would never become president without iowa caucuses, say jerry crawford, longtime iowa democratic organizer working clinton campaign. iowa convinced people obama medium phenomenon barack obama, too, relied iowa first victory campaign hillary clinton 2008. day caucuses, trailed hillary clinton 20 point national polls. day there, shot within 5 point her. the result iowa validating us, say larry grisolano, consulted obamas campaign year. people became convinced obama medium phenomenon — candidate could attract votes. obamas win made surge within striking distance clinton national polls, far another important early contest, south carolina. iowa peculiarity played strengths, grisolano adds. don’t know would’ve turned started place advertisingcentric. even iowa winner doesnt end winning nomination (as mike huckabee rick santorum, two recent gop winners), caucus result shake race elevating them, rather candidates, prominence contest. the caucus exceeds expectation fails to. set expectations? do. but important understand every candidate affected equally caucuses. iowa matter primarily change perception political world. candidate are, large part, judged whether caucus performance meet expectation medium political elites. for instance, 2008 gop caucuses, mitt romney came second john mccain came fourth. yet romney portrayed big loser, since campaigning hard iowa seemed favorite win. mccain, meanwhile, hadnt really trying win iowa focusing instead well new hampshire, fourthplace finish wasnt interpreted stunning setback him. every candidate iowa opponent, opponent’s name expected, say goldford. caucus exceeds expectation fails to. set expectations? do. 5) bizarre way pick president. iowa granted much power? essentially, iowa moved caucus front line perfect moment. happened back 1972, democratic party overhauling nomination process give actual voters, party bosses, say. thats presidential nomination system know today — monthslong sequence staggered primary caucus every state territory — came about. (republicans adopted similar reform soon afterward.) but 1972 — first nomination contest reformed system — iowa democrat slated usual caucus unusually early date january 24. people offer various different explanation so: deliberate effort help favorite son considering running president, arcane party rule change required 30 day pas various state local events, even lack available hotel room de moines summer necessitated earlier state convention date (which necessitated earlier caucus date). whatever reason, iowa democratic caucus moved ahead new hampshire primary, traditionally nation first. people political community concluded, happened told u something at first, people outside iowa noticed cared, 1972 caucus result got little attention nationally. retrospect, george mcgovern shockingly democratic nomination, insider secondguessing failed predict rise concluded paid attention finished surprisingly strong second iowa. people political community concluded, happened told u something. told u weak frontrunner. told u energy antiwar movement, say david yepsen, former political reporter de moines register. savvy iowan party worked hard promote idea iowa early bellwether. democrat arranged event topline result could easily reported national press, republican moved caucus day create unified event would get lot medium buzz. tom whitney, state democratic chair, later told iowa public television: basically ‘74 elections, organized very, significant kind effort convince first candidate ought iowa national press going here, convince national press iowa candidate going here. so carter victory iowa general election werent great — ended great iowa, could claim kingmaker. future candidate party spent time money there, national press started regularly covering result major event. party insider voter early state began taking iowa result seriously, too. ever since, state party tenaciously successfully fought keep caucus first, helped new precedent set, brookings fellow elaine kamarck chronicle book primary politics. 6) everyone okay giving iowa much say? not all! many critics, including vox dylan matthews, argue iowa population unrepresentative country whole — state much white rural, fewer foreignborn people. others criticize caucus setup itself: event take long time, theyre scheduled specific time evening, there absentee voting past, depresses turnout could make even unrepresentative. (four five registered party member iowa vast majority independent voter usually dont show up.) i think [iowa] distorts process good way, say operative state furthermore, democrat dont even get secret ballot, mean social pressure could skew results. gop side, turnout recently dominated evangelical activists, many opted candidate lack national appeal, like huckabee santorum. and presidential candidate party long felt compelled voice fealty powerful interest group state, like big corn (though peverill squire convincingly argues procorn policy mainly driven congress, white house). finally, seems plain unfair lot people state iowa get power. caucus defender respond saying iowa skew result — positively. think distorts process good way, say crawford, hillary clinton organizer. thats iowa state retail campaigning oneonone interaction voters, rather simply big money ad buys, matter. voter shown dont follow prevailing national wind — theyre willing give littleknown poorly funded challenger chance, help ensure democratic contest overall. iowa level playing ground, say iowa gop operative eric woolson. iowa electorate pay attention whats going on. in case, every attempt supplant iowa failed, neither national party agree else first line, alternative way thing entirely. state tried jump line — like louisiana 1996 — contest boycotted (at iowa pol behest) deemed meaningless national elite press. eventually, national party accepted iowa new hampshire hellbent going first second — vast majority state didnt care much. party began harshly penalizing state tried move nomination contest early. accordingly, nobody even bothered try leapfrog iowa time around. 7) okay, stuck iowa going first now. tell itll affect year race. once again, lesson political world take away caucus really important — delegate end allotted. everyone anxious see actual iowa result measure expectations, help better understand actually win. theyll looking major things. in gop contest, everyone anxiously awaiting answer one key question: donald trump get people actually vote him? despite trump monthslong lead national polls, there still great deal skepticism elite him: perhaps poll overstate support, perhaps campaign doesnt good ground game, perhaps supporter arent regular gop primary caucus voter wont bother show up, perhaps electorate flock seemingly electable candidate last minute. if trump win iowa, prepare medium frenzy like youve never seen before since caucus turnout difficult pollster model since ted cruz perceived better organization trump, much political world long expected trump finish second, behind cruz. yet trump taken lead recent poll — perverse effect raising expectation him. now, second place finish would viewed disappointment him. come third worse, hell portrayed loser went pathetic defeat. manage actually win caucuses, hell debunk much skepticism mentioned above, prove wont vanishing contest anytime soon — unleash medium frenzy like youve never seen before. the iowa result big implication gop candidate too. since ted cruz led poll recently, loss would perceived serious blow candidacy. marco rubio, meanwhile, currently polling third place, thats people expect end up. rubio manages surprise people placing second even first, hell get huge amount positive buzz going new hampshire. somehow fall behind — especially another establishmentfriendly candidate like jeb bush chris christie pass — whispered doubt campaign competence vindicated, whoever beat momentum medium coverage buzz among elite week granite state contest. candidate entirely manages surge late iowa (as rick santorum 2012), expect major player next contests, too. meanwhile, democratic side, bernie sander suddenly surged iowa poll full year trailing clinton. since he long ahead new hampshire, he positioned seriously compete early states. come raised expectations. clinton win contest outright, sander movement could well fizzle out, could wrap nomination quickly. sander win either, though, even come close iowa, expect pitched battle two last quite time. (and unless martin omalley vastly exceeds current low singledigit percent support iowa, expect drop soon afterward.) the nightmare scenario clinton point — implausible — sander win iowa new hampshire. happens, political elite press mercilessly mock secondguess clinton campaign weeks. yet insider also understand state heavily white representative diverse democratic electorate overall. big question whether positive coverage sander get improve performance among nonwhite democrat seemed uninterested candidacy far — put test next contest, south carolina. it goofy way it, agree. absent clear alternative... if feel like needed decoder ring make sense that, youre alone. one sat designed bizarre presidential nomination system — indeed, even iowan admit one would ever sit design exact system scratch. goofy way it, agree, say yepsen. absent clear alternative process continues. candidate keep investing time money, medium keep giving saturation coverage results, political elite keep believing iowa matter — iowa keep mattering. this article originally published january 25, 2016. updated latest expectation candidate perform caucuses.",0,left,Vox,2016

stop bill becoming law. negotiated unanimous consent agreement [to let senate function] every day” rather trying aggressively disrupt reid’s process,” say james wallner, former senate heritage

contribute sweeping republican gain 2010 midterm — albeit gain weren’t large enough give mcconnell longcoveted majority yet. rubik’s cube wasn’t yet solved. managing extreme party republican got part wanted. controlled house representative starting 2011. new class conservative extreme one mcconnell worked year — presented problem. despite lacking control presidency senate, new conservative activist backing demanding sweeping change — demand that, mcconnell’s views, often unrealistic. mcconnell took new legislative role, managing party’s extreme elements, could better help win next election. trey grayson, former kentucky secretary state allied mcconnell, sum way: think him, there’s realization: ‘okay, republican electorate here. i’m gonna adapt folks. i’m gonna give rope run with. i’ve got make sure don’t hang it.” it complicated dance, mcconnell also wanted remain good side conservative base element flexed muscle several recent primary fights. often — debt ceiling fight

breach debt ceiling. knew would disaster go fiscal cliff. knew would disaster shut government, though unable avoid one,” say jentleson, former reid aide. thought making deal case good politics.” but though tactic legislation shifted, approached nomination remained same. since senate get approve appointees, republican filibuster remained tool gop block nominee found objectionable. mcconnell therefore ramped use hold filibuster ever further. according 2013 congressional research service report, senate attempted overcome filibuster nomination 168 time since 1949 — 82 attempts, nearly half total, occurred obama’s presidency alone. dc circuit court appeal particular — jurisdiction many regulatory case impacting businesses, gop therefore much wanted keep conservative hand — republican made clear they’d block obama nominee. all eventually proved bridge far democrats. 2013, harry reid used nuclear option” ram senate rule change would eliminate filibuster nomination except supreme court picks. mcconnell still certain tactic could use delay appointments, stripped best tool blocking outright. it spurred mcconnell deliver january 2014 speech restoring senate.” it, made case

fill vacancy, liberal would get first majority court decades. conservative activist who’d long deeply cared court’s makeup — religious reasons, others disliked big government — terrified. mcconnell’s audacious response — preventing senate even holding hearing obama’s nominee, merrick garland, ramming rule change confirm donald trump’s nominee, neil gorsuch — play central role legacy. the best mcconnell’s legacy perspective probably going gorsuch,” say jason pye freedomworks. took lot pressure [blocking garland], commend it.” but though many liberal believe mcconnell pulled masterful heist

and, knowing that, wouldn’t walmart try increase wage keep you? advocate say walmart would. empirical evidence side india, type job guarantee known national rural employment guarantee scheme function largely insurance system, offering source income rural farmer dry season. a group economist — uc san diego’s karthik muralidharan paul niehaus university virginia’s sandip sukhtankar — found job guarantee, estimate, increased earnings lowincome household 13.3 percent. ninety percent increase due higher wage increased work private sector, job guarantee program itself. just job guarantee advocate would predict, program bid wage everywhere. perhaps surprising result program increased wages, increased employment private sector. the political case job guarantee — challenge face the fact cory booker, rising star democratic party likely 2020 contender face considerable skepticism left due stance education wall street, endorsed experimenting job guarantee clear indication party think could political winner well policy advance. in wake 2016 election, liberal commentator latched onto job guarantee way forge crossracial workingclass coalition. need plan appeal to white wisconsin michigan voter switched obama trump black latino worker left behind deindustrialization. ideal plan would improve condition lowerincome american supporting americans’ strong intuition people work earn crust. a federal job guarantee universal—it benefit americans—and specifically ameliorative entrenched racial inequality,” slate’s jamelle bouie noted. the job guarantee asserts that, individual bear moral duty work, society employer bear reciprocal moral duty provide good, dignified work all,” jeff spross added influential centerleft journal democracy. if democrat want win elections, imbue trump’s empty rhetoric real promise: good job every american want one,” wrote bryce covert new republic. it’s time make federal job guarantee central tenet party’s platform.” a sufficiently big idea, however, job guarantee come risks. would expensive, one thing. paul, darity, hamilton’s plan, outlined cbpp, would cost $543 billion per year, estimate. context, rival size medicare, cost $707 billion year, size defense budget, total $622 billion. center american progress proposed modest $158 billion per year government job plan, wouldn’t actually guarantee job sought one, paul, darity, hamilton proposed. booker’s bill doesn’t estimated cost yet. second, it’s clear exactly participant job guarantee scheme would do. proposal somewhat vague point, mentioning everything child care infrastructure. booker bill leaf locality figure out. cities, counties, area would get chance apply program, department labor would required pick mix urban rural area try idea in. program running, vast majority job offered would public sector, participant need skill development would offered eight week training. position meeting list national job priority … shall include child care, care senior individual disabilities, [and] infrastructure activities” would encouraged, private sector employer would benefit work opportunity tax credit, benefit currently give employer thousand dollar toward wage hire veterans, welfare food stamp recipients, exfelons, people barrier employment. beyond that, bill doesn’t give many specifics. a job guarantee would ideally provide job nice could nixed economy improves program shrink size. pretty hard identify. job guarantee enacted recession, many enrollee became child care providers, happens economy improves worker find job private sector? wouldn’t tenable eliminate universal child care program economy improved. nor, program employed bus drivers, would make much sense cut bus routes. the booker bill requires program subject ongoing rigorous evaluation, would help determine wellequipped local government make kind distinctions. would welcome addition research literature, there’s past evidence suggesting program like struggle succeed. berkeley economist david card recently conducted metaanalysis 200 evaluation program meant boost labor markets, along fellow economist jochen kluve andrea weber. found variety impact different programs, one constant public employment program simply hired people directly performed worst. public sector employment subsidy tend negligible even negative impact horizons,” study concludes. pattern suggests private employer place little value experience gained public sector program.” one reason, suggested, program nothing help build skill would make participant employable. a job guarantee, though, would entirely different scale, booker bill would enable evaluation could determine effect like successful indian program failed effort card, kluve, weber studied. with donald trump white house republican charge house congress, it’s doubtful booker’s bill become law anytime soon. that’s really point. proposal, closest thing job guarantee bill congress rep. john conyers’s (dmi) humphreyhawkins 21st century full employment training act, named largely failed 1970s bill pushed civil right activist union enact job guarantee. bill fell short establishing formal guarantee, conyers since resigned congress sexual harassment scandal. booker put idea back democratic agenda, form could readily passed relatively minimal cost (given pilot program nature) democrat next power. that’s important step, one significantly improves odds idea part next democratic president’s todo list.",0,left,Vox,2018
