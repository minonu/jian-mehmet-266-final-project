case whether existing federal ban sex discrimination forbids employment discrimination lgbtq workers. zarda bostock involve donald zarda gerald bostock, gay men allege fired sexual orientation. harris

discrimination, discrimination based worker’s sexual orientation gender identity. case ask whether concept like sexual orientation gender identity tightly bound concept sex (meaning gender, sexual intercourse) ban sex discrimination necessarily protects lgbtq workers. they also first big test supreme court’s new majority treat lgbtq right cases. though retired justice anthony kennedy conservative, also authored court’s important gay right cases. zarda, bostock, harris funeral home tell u great deal whether possible assemble prolgbtq majority supreme court without kennedy’s vote. zoom little three case loom even larger. 1989, supreme court held gender stereotyping form sex discrimination — woman may fired, example, boss deem masculine appearance conduct. yet, one federal appeal court explained 2017, samesex attraction ultimate case failure conform” gender stereotype. something similar could said stereotypical view people’s gender must align sex assigned birth. thus, supreme court hold lawful discriminate gay trans workers, could upend 30yearold rule gender stereotyping. worker — straight queer; trans, cis, nonbinary — could become le secure jobs. even court go far, would difficult rule plaintiff without carving significant exception broad rule sex stereotyping allowed. a national women’s law center argues amicus brief filed behalf long list women’s groups, argument advanced employers, accepted, would roll back protection discrimination based sex stereotyping long understood federal courts, equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc), employers,

conservative member avowed textualists — meaning hew late justice antonin scalia’s belief ultimately provision law rather principal concern legislator governed.” text law must obeyed, view, even text

plaintiffs. these three cases, words, show whether several court’s conservative member able set aside political view textualist principle lead liberal result. show gay right revolution kennedy helped lead halt — even potentially go reverse — kennedy longer court. when text law odds originally intended purpose title vii prohibits employment discrimination occurs [an employee’s] race, color,

sex” banned — say particular case. this zarda, bostock, harris funeral home easy cases. take case gay plaintiffs. plaintiff men allege fired sexual attraction men. presumably employer would permit woman work company sexually attracted men. that’s basic sex discrimination. the employers, it’s worth, reject reading title vii, arguing court must isolate sex” determine whether discrimination took place. long employer would fire employee samesex attractions, argument goes, sex discrimination taken place. show sex discrimination, gay male plaintiff must show employer treat gay men worse lesbians. but it’s hard square argument title vii’s expansive ban discrimination sex.” zarda say response adversary’s argument, company fired men loving romance novels, continued employ woman loved books,” would sex discrimination. company also fired woman (but men) love automotive repair manuals” wouldn’t transform case sex discrimination case literaryorientation discrimination.” would simply double employer’s liability.” the analysis harris funeral homes, case involving trans woman, even straightforward. think case employer’s perspective. employer belief aimee stephen man stephen

gender norms. boss’ rule men must dress act one way woman must dress act different way. that’s sex discrimination. a appeal court decided harris funeral home explained, analytically impossible fire employee based employee’s status transgender person without motivated, least part, employee’s sex.” the hidden stake case a decision plaintiff three case would leave many american without recourse fired sexual orientation gender identity. also broader implications. decision could also undercut civil right protection supreme court already recognizes — including, potentially, safeguard sex stereotyping sexual harassment. let’s start sex stereotyping. supreme court’s decision price waterhouse v. hopkins (1989), recognized stereotyping violates title vii, bit messy court hand single majority opinion. nevertheless, clear majority court supported holding sex stereotyping allowed. justice william brennan wrote plurality opinion behalf three justices, concluding congress intended strike entire spectrum disparate treatment men woman resulting sex stereotypes” enacted title vii. justice sandra day o’connor, meanwhile, wrote separate opinion concluding plaintiff price waterhouse could proceed showed stereotypical attitude towards woman [played] significant, though unquantifiable, role” employer’s decision promote her. so that’s four vote brennan’s position plus fifth vote o’connor — majority court say sex stereotyping allowed. justice anthony kennedy, meanwhile, wrote dissenting opinion arguing title vii creates independent cause action sex stereotyping.” kennedy wrote evidence use decisionmakers sex stereotype is, course, quite relevant question discriminatory intent,” denied stereotyping, itself, violates title vii. bear kennedy’s opinion mind read passage trump administration’s brief harris funeral homes: stephens’s sixth circuit’s sexstereotyping argument rest incorrect premise price waterhouse construed title vii prohibit sex stereotype per se. case, produced majority opinion, merely recognized plaintiff use evidence employer engaged sex stereotyping show employer discriminated sex ordinary title vii rubric. recognize sex stereotyping novel, freestanding category title vii liability. the trump administration’s position identical position dissent took price waterhouse. rather brazenly calling doover 1989 case, perhaps hoping court’s current, conservative majority pretend kennedy’s dissenting view carried day three decade ago. the crux trump administration’s position sex stereotyping plaintiff must prove defendant treated member one sex le favorably similarly situated member opposite sex.” far clear mean practice. a straight man might believe treated le favorably” female colleague forbidden engaging romantic relationship men, gay plaintiff bostick zarda would doubt see question differently. question constitutes le favorable” treatment quite subjective. trump administration’s position would give judge increasingly conservative federal bench enormous discretion decide victim sex stereotyping allowed prevail. a brief women’s group warns, principled reason justifies limiting title vii prohibit some, all, form sex stereotyping,” attempt establish limit would make title vii impossible navigate courts, employers, employees, would guess whether particular behavior conduct related sex stereotype related sexual orientation gender identity—and thus, prohibited federal law—or, whether tied sexual orientation gender identity deemed outside scope sex discrimination barred title vii.” unlike sex stereotyping, sexual harassment explicitly issue zarda, bostock, harris funeral homes. yet decision defendant case could eventually signal end legal protection victim sexual harassment. a explained above, central

(stone would later claim since came midst scandal surrounding stone’s old friend paul manafort’s ukraine work, merely predicting podesta’s business dealing would exposed.”) a october began, stone took new role — wikileaks’ hype man. claimed inside knowledge, saying friend” met assange learned mother lode coming wednesday.” tweeted: wednesday @hillaryclinton done. #wikileaks.” nothing came wednesday, stone tweeted, libs thinking assange stand wishful thinking. payload coming. #lockthemup.” assange published podesta email two day later. immediately, question whether garrulous operative involved, eventually spurred wikileaks tweet group never communicated roger stone.” atlantic later reported stone dmed wikileaks twitter account afterward, complaining attacking” him. false claim association used democrat undermine impact publications,” wikileaks responded. don’t go don’t want u correct you.” stone shot back: ha! ‘correct’ people think you’re lying. operation leak like sieve. need figure friend are.” what make this? stone obviously contact two key leakers, public statement show one point wanted people think inside line wikileaks’ plans. however, he’s repeatedly denied inside knowledge involvement, haven’t seen clear evidence truly knowledge. in case, might learn mueller’s probe soon enough. want testify roger,” sam nunberg said year, referring special counsel’s team. want say roger going around telling people colluding julian assange.” 6) peter smith’s hunt hillary’s deleted emails: last certainly least, one emailrelated subplot 2016 campaign — it’s weird one. this one involves separate set emails: word got hillary clinton used personal email account work state department, agreed hand workrelated email account government investigators. turned previously deemed 32,000 email (about half total) personal” rather workrelated, deleted them. conservative like longtime republican operative peter smith didn’t take clinton’s explanation deleted email face value questioned whether could contained scandalous behavior criminal evidence. number included gop presidential nominee donald trump. russia, you’re listening, hope you’re able find 30,000 [hillary clinton] email missing,” trump said july 27, 2016, press conference. think probably rewarded mightily press. let’s see happens. next.” it around time smith began unusual project. assumed clinton’s email server hacked email must somewhere, dark web.” reached computer expert conservative activists, hoping assemble team would track emails. smith didn’t work trump campaign. said repeatedly claimed contact michael flynn, advising trump. one recruiting document smith sent cybersecurity expert matt tait contained subheader trump campaign (in coordination extent permitted independent expenditure).” listed several names: steve bannon, kellyanne conway, sam clovis, flynn, lisa nelson. (bannon conway denied involvement. three haven’t commented.) eventually, smith gave version happened wall street journal’s shane harris. said team found five hacker group said clinton’s emails, two seemed russian. knew people probably around russian government,” smith said. however, went on, couldn’t determine whether email authentic, ended advising hacker give wikileaks. email ever surfaced. smith — 81 year old poor health — killed may 2017, 10 day speaking harris. smith’s effort appears failed. smith admitted tried get stolen document group understood russian governmenttied. question michael flynn’s role — particularly since, per harris’s sources, intelligence report say russian hacker discussed could get leaked email flynn’s hands. much remains murky situation, flynn cooperating mueller’s team part plea deal, special counsel likely know whatever does. mueller likely bring charge email hacking matter. whom? last november, wall street journal’s aruna viswanatha del quentin wilber reported justice department identified six russian government official involved dnc hack considering bringing charges. interestingly, though, report claimed special counsel robert mueller chosen take dnc hack investigation relatively technical” already way nearly year.” that appears since changed. nbc news daily beast reported march mueller taken charge email hacking investigation. washington post reported january mueller added veteran cyber prosecutor,” ryan dickey, team. (credit marcy wheeler flagging point.) so it’s pretty safe bet mueller bring charge related email hackings. judging past indictments, he’ll also use tell story exactly happened, extent can. is, all, good deal still don’t know — instance, how, exactly, dnc podesta email get hacker wikileaks? it’s important remember know — could still public. certainly possible several contact real purported leaker hacker listed went nowhere, it’s bit harder believe six separate contact resulted nothing consequence. mueller already gotten three people tied trump plead guilty cooperate investigation. getting george papadopoulos, got earliest known tip russian hacked emails? getting michael flynn, may tied peter smith’s effort get clinton email russian hackers? getting rick gates, paul manafort’s righthand man campaign? all three men pleaded guilty, haven’t seen fruit cooperation yet. may providing mueller information hacked emails, may not. it’s safe say they’re telling mueller good deal that’s interest — eventually, find what.",0,left,Vox,2018

remained elevated level 2011. first glance, then, might appear nation made little progress—or even gone backwards—in fighting war poverty, official rate doesn’t tell whole story. some expert argue official rate inaccurate measure wellbeing lowincome american omits effect tax many antipoverty program provide valuable support lowincome american families. 2008 discussion paper hamilton project,

bennett’s hugh hewitt’s radio programs, refuse interview actual conservative like breitbart news, mark levin, sean hannity, rush limbaugh defend himself—the omnibus spending bill, breitbart news detailed, absolute disaster conservatives. funded pretty much every single progressive objective president barack obama’s effort fundamentally change america, even surrendered previous small victory ryan’s predecessor, john boehner, able secure, school choice voucher program washington, d.c. ryan abandoned effort promote conservative agenda” year ago. instead, ryan one central advocate republican party amnesty illegal alien wide open border massively increased immigration america. ryan, course, built giant fence around mansion hometown janesville, wisconsin, omnibus spending bill, didn’t provide funding fence united state border mexico—a fence provided federal law year yet built. ryan also promised preomnibus interview fox news’s sean hannity wouldn’t support cut muslim migration america. came house freedom caucus, according chairman, rep. jim jordan (roh), failed obtain commitment muslim migration backing speaker. that’s mention ryan’s close relationship rep. luis gutierrez (dil), progressive left’s champion illegal aliens. ryan also served one chief promoters—an architect, will—of obamatrade plan. helped shove trade promotion authority (tpa) fasttrack legislation—which aim grease skid 5,544pagelong transpacific partnership (tpp) globalist trade deal empowers sultan brunei potentially put american community risk succumbing sultan’s brand sharia law due sovereignty concern regarding land control deal—through house conservative objections. ryan, course, breitbart news reported time, also snuck phony fix immigration provision tpa plan. after buzzfeed’s mckay coppins wrote one vicious inaccurate profile now2016 gop frontrunner donald trump—prompting trump call scumbag” expose lewd behavior toward woman working trump’s maralago resort—ryan took coppins church glowing liberal profile leftist rag. that’s mention ryan’s horrendous big picture spending budget deals. latest omnibus—which, again, ryan desperately tried defend kind win conservatives, everyone including house minority leader nancy pelosi know that’s true—is hardly first awful big deal. back late 2013, thenhouse budget committee chairman paul ryan negotiated budget deal thensenate budget committee chairwoman sen. patty murray (dwa). a breitbart news reported time, along analysis sen. jeff session (ral), ryanmurray budget deal increased national deficit least $15.5 billion. despite spending increase—again, hardly conservative principle—the deal cut veterans’ pension order pay funding tax credit united state government, ryan’s urging, wrongly paying illegal alien across country. ryan frequently also swooped last minute bail gop establishment effort spend taxpayer money. backed socalled cromnibus” late 2014, bill that—after virtually every republican promised campaign trail, including party chairman reince priebus—ended funding president obama’s 2014 executive amnesty illegal alien adult 2012 deferred action childhood (daca) executive amnesty illegal alien children. all that’s tip iceberg ryan’s anticonservative action congress—a taste what’s come keep following historical viewpoint pushing conservative agenda.” so, first new year’s resolution thoroughly debunked—he may end changing, conservative hope does, people don’t change—let’s look rest them. a gop unity,” ryan end securing support many house freedom caucus members—more majority them—he actually never earned official endorsement group speakership bid. gotten that, ryan would needed 80 percent group support house speakership race. ryan failed achieve that. interestingly enough, ryan pledged american people—and house republicans—that wouldn’t run house speakership without endorsement house freedom caucus, decision run speakership beginning was, like many thing he’s done, built abject lie. many house republican given ryan pas first couple month speaker. blame boehner lot problem conference, mess currently exists. again, ryan continues pathway he’s far, it’s hard see enough republican conference standing behind continuing support him. liberal wing gop conference, hand, likely continue push ryan support boehneresque kstreet goodieladen legislation—and divide almost certainly going split unity” ryan pushing for. ryan’s third promise new year—decentralized power” away speaker’s office—has, credit, seen advancement, although minor grand scheme things. ryan allowed rep. tim huelskamp (rks) onto powerful house steering committee, entity decides member get committees. senior conservative aides—chiefs staff senior aides—tell breitbart news ryan’s team much open boehner’s legislative process listening concerns. it’s really hard better nothing—what boehner was, bad he’d literally call republican member swear word even trying work conservatives—so it’s huge improvement ryan’s part. remains seen ryan implement actual structural reform house representative whatsoever, hasn’t time done that. he did, however, failing earn official endorsement house freedom caucus, walk closeddoor meeting group basically promise world. ryan promised he’d give five votes—which help speaker centralize power—the speaker steering committee; wouldn’t amnesty immigration bill president obama left office; pledged end retaliation gop member gop leadership, promised return regular order. during freedom caucus meeting, ryan’s plan way he’d run speaker house republican surrendered ability house rules—he wanted change rules—to bring floor what’s called resolution vacate chair. procedure—which conservative used successfully bring boehner knee force office—would forcefully remove speaker wasn’t fulfilling the conference elected her. rule literally put place thomas jefferson, founding father, america’s third president, author america’s declaration independence tyrant king george great britain 1776. good enough ryan, seems. he hasn’t given five vote speaker steering committee. broke immigration pledge inserting omnibus bill massive increase h2b visa allow guest worker america. hasn’t done anything prevent retaliation conservatives. hasn’t taken step back towards regular order—and fact used back room procedure block amendment legislation national importance, specifically flawed refugee resettlement bill ryan falsely claimed paused” obama’s plan resettle thousand syrian city town across america wake paris terrorist attacks. thing bill require three people serve pleasure president—the fbi director, secretary homeland security, director national intelligence—to sign president’s plans. ryan jammed bill house bringing floor closed rule—blocking amendment member house—then ryan proceeded fund entire program taxpayer dollars. that mean ryan already broken second half fourth new year’s resolution—regular order—and first half resolution, transparency, ryan one covered least couple different places. firstly, ryan’s prespeakershipbid meeting house freedom caucus, second demand—in addition eliminating house rule jefferson’s rule tyrannical speaker—ryan member couldn’t tell anyone happened meeting, breitbart news reported time. then there’s also obamatrade again. back member pushing through—at ryan’s insistence—the

"house democrats’ internal feud prescription drug prices, explained",2019-06-17,"the united state highest prescription drug price world, summer, democratic house leadership unveil plan fix — though question remain effective measure be. reducing prescription drug price key plank house democrats’ platform 2018 midterms. six month term, however, concrete bill yet emerge house leadership subject, early excerpt speaker nancy pelosi floated spurred progressive concern. curbing rise prescription drug price problem democrat wanted solve time. way industry currently regulated, many pharmaceutical company established monopoly certain drug significant leeway come determining cost medications. a result, u boast highest prescription drug price developed country, leading shocking cost thousand drug including insulin. recently, gene therapy treatment novartis priced whopping $2.1 million. despite democrats’ consensus problem broad way solve (more government regulation), there’s disagreement among lawmaker best route take. although pelosi’s bill yet finalized, laid general outline various caucus meetings, including recent update responded progressive pushback: according piece she’s revealed far, bill would enable health human service secretary alex azar negotiate prescription drug covered medicare, final price would decided government accountability office agreement could initially reached. that approach differs significantly two bills, one introduced rep. ro khanna (dca) sen. bernie sander (ivt), rep. lloyd doggett (dtx) sen. sherrod brown (doh). doggett brown’s legislation, garnered support congressional progressive caucus, would include gao middleman negotiations. additionally, would enable pharmaceutical company’s competitor produce generic version drug firm engage negotiation fairly. a key difference democrats’ option — involving third party negotiations, even it’s government body — point contention, due concern added step might make process clunkier, also limiting potential price reductions. to top off, progressive argue process developing bill opaque — although they’ve heartened latest tweak house leadership, politico reports. according senior democratic aide, head two major committee jurisdiction legislation making round different democratic constituency try flesh proposal. we need type transparency writing drug pricing legislation pricing drugs,” doggett told vox statement. a lawmaker await final version bill spearheaded pelosi, still outstanding question whether ambitious enough. the hhs secretary isn’t currently allowed negotiate prescription price directly house democrats’ legislation, whatever form wind taking, intended address major problem see way prescription drug negotiation work. under current law, hhs secretary barred directly negotiating price prescription drug covered medicare, arrangement established 2003 part medicare modernization act set medicare’s prescription drug benefit. presently, private plan offer medicare part benefit negotiate drug cost independently. often lack leverage secure kind reduction government may able obtain, given bargaining power. proponent changing system argue federal government could significantly sway directly involved pricing discussions, especially medicare beneficiary represent roughly third prescription drug expenditure annual basis. point department veteran affairs, negotiates prescription drug price retired active troop u military, able obtain medicine major discount compared rest market. pharmaceutical company counter drug price reflect high cost research development go producing groundbreaking medicines. and, historically, republican argued government shouldn’t get involved determining price anyway. in 2016, however, president donald trump signaled interested changing 2003 law well. time, trump argued government needed get involved reducing prescription drug prices, stance gop previously pushed against. because trump’s position, pelosi repeatedly suggested issue one area democrat could potentially work get legislation congress. successful, it’s something democrat president could tout substantive bipartisan achievement. what know pelosi bill — two big reason it’s raised progressive ire at moment, final version pelosi bill still flux, though official rollout expected coming months. huffpost’s zach carter daniel marans previously reported, contour proposal described caucus meeting late may spurred outcry progressive argued legislation didn’t go far enough hold pharmaceutical company accountable. pelosi recently signaled making update proposal response critique it’s received, hill’s peter sullivan reports. here’s know speaker’s plan far, though piece finalized: it would enable hhs secretary azar negotiate pharmaceutical company price drug covered medicare. if company hhs able reach agreement, government accountability office — independent agency conduct research advises congress — would help set final price. (this different binding arbitration process proposed house speaker earlier version measure.) a reference point pricesetting, gao would use median pricing particular drug country around world. the plan calling negotiation target roughly 250 drugs, though cap number drug would part negotiations. if company comply negotiation particular drug, would penalized excise tax 50 percent sale drug previous year. while gao seen better option thirdparty private arbiter (something floated prior talks) critic leadership plan, there’s lot unanswered question exactly body would handle job. gao usually tasked delivering oversight report government activities, managing government negotiations. if gao provided resource construct inhouse unit this, that’s definitely possible,” say rachel sachs, law professor washington university st. louis. george mason university health policy professor len nichols agreed gao certainly capable,” though noted guidance health economist would crucial. the role gao could potentially play part proposal that’s prompted questions, however. the idea drug minimum also emerged another point contention. previously, pelosi suggested 25drug floor, though speaker since said plan would aim target 250 drugs. critic expressed worry number set legislation would instead become de facto maximum, negotiation would peter agreement reached select number drugs. advocate favor establishing drug floor suggest would force hhs secretary engage negotiation set list drugs, least, note specific group drug account high proportion spending. data show congress focus medicare price negotiation key drug reason willie sutton robbed banks; that’s money is,” said ben wakana, executive director patient affordable drug statement. expert subject also note prescription drug negotiation would likely tested smaller pool effort could effectively implemented broadly. the discussion around trying limited amount drug start with, figure infrastructure needed it’s going work,” university pittsburgh health policy professor walid gellad tell vox. even proponent idea aren’t limited numerical fashion would agree prioritization important. won’t possible administration negotiate drug first year,” say sachs. progressive also worried pharma accountability beyond mechanic negotiations, one progressives’ biggest concern whether bill adequate backstop ding company financial penalty don’t comply process. pelosi’s proposal safeguards, huffpost reports: company refused participate would slapped tax equal 50 percent prior year’s sale drug. price drug covered medicare part b could increased going forward, company still would 100% price hike taxed away. doggett’s bill, however, 100 cosponsors, take much aggressive tack matter. if company treat negotiation fairly, doggett’s bill would enable hhs issue license competitor would able produce drug generic, effectively eliminating company’s monopoly particular drug. this approach would push company approach negotiation around drug pricing seriously — make sure patient could still access particular drug even company manufacturing opted negotiations. it’s difference policy a case many clash progressive house leadership, tension recent month fueled process behind legislation’s rollout. many progressive previously said felt like there’s startling lack communication bill developed. people included,” congressional progressive caucus cochair mark pocan (dwi) told politico’s adam cancryn early june. process now.” house leadership seemingly taking progressive feedback account, however. past week, pelosi’s decision target roughly 250 drug evidence that, it’s move that’s since heralded cpc cochair rep. pramila jayapal (dwa), politico reports. leadership committee jurisdiction continue solicit feedback incorporate idea across caucus order develop strongest, boldest possible legislation lower prescription drug price americans,” pelosi spokesperson henry connelly told vox. democratic leadership also talk staffer white house months, given trump’s interest working issue. make confusing optics, expert argue collaboration vital getting anything passed signed law. senior democratic aide told vox conversation white house focus subject simply discussion negotiations. still, openness working alongside trump issue — even administration flagrantly obstructs democratic effort investigation — prompted left question whether even capacity reliable partner. let’s live promise go small attempt satisfy president cannot satisfied,” doggett said. trump’s recent tantrum infrastructure, seems unlikely count purported administration legislative endorsement.” the future bill air reducing prescription drug price — much like tackling surprise medical bill — issue widespread voter support, make likely something could actually make divided congress. according 2018 poll kaiser family foundation, 96 percent democrat support giving government ability negotiate directly order reduce drug price medicare, 92 percent republican feel same. bringing drug price would clear political victory lawmaker side aisle. trump’s interest working issue provided republican cover back away historic position protecting pharmaceutical business interests, say brendan buck, partner blue engine media, previously advised former house speaker paul ryan. the president totally shuffled politics issue way that’s pretty remarkable,” told vox. new willingness republican take drug company didn’t exist five year ago.” buck added, however, white house support bill may enough win senate republicans. i caution idea [democrats] work white house, unreliability, senate care lot this,” said, adding, outcome drug pricing progressive caucus endorse mitch mcconnell put floor.” that tension repeatedly put house democratic leader tough spot, could ultimately evident whatever bill speaker finally unveils. on one hand, democratic leader interested securing bipartisan win, could mean bill concession trump republican accept, according huffpost. other, progressive activist lawmaker pushing proposal would send strong message drug pricing, though legislation may become law soon. with current configuration senate, you’re going get legislation that’s aggressive enough make lot people happy democratic side,” nichols said. don’t think we’re talking legislation actually pas senate.” other smaller reform — like creates act, target tactic pharmaceutical company use deter competition, recently passed house — appear still chance, however. given context, progressive wondering democratic leader don’t push

one part answer straightforward: interstate migration increasing. instead, downward trend since 1980s; fewer american (as share population) relocating across state line couple decade ago. the part little complicated. people leave area don’t necessarily resemble one stay. instead, there’s evidence migrants’ political belief mirror voter new destination. many people moving liberal state conservative state may conservative, may least end way long. people moving conservative state liberal state may liberal. of course, certain state attract certain type voter job opportunity change — north carolina’s research triangle, instance. time noted, number red state (such idaho south carolina) home many blue state transplant yet continue vote reliably republican. there’s little sign that’s changing. if anything, mover generally extreme political view natives: people moving west coast new england, example, liberal people grew there. thus, process intracountry migration could contributing political polarization rather making state purple. we get sense general social survey, national biannual poll conducted university chicago. g asks respondent rate liberal conservative. g also asks census division respondent live in, lived 16 year old. using g data, figure percentage people consider liberal among different groups: longterm residents: people lived region 16 remain now; former residents: people lived region 16 live different one now; new residents: people live region didn’t 16. this method imperfect: census division don’t overlay perfectly political regions, g doesn’t drill state level. also, although we’ve gathered data version g since 2004, sample size aren’t huge. still, data enough suggest people moving away region ideologically distinct continue live there. example, people moved away south atlantic region (which includes number fairly conservative states) liberal people moved away new england regions. despite fact 22 percent people stayed south atlantic division consider liberal, compared 27 percent american overall. instead, mover common new neighbors; liberal attracted liberal regions, conservative conservative regions. next plot shows, politics longterm resident correlate reasonably well politics new residents. the relationship isn’t perfect (the correlation coefficient .62), trend reasonably clear. example, middle atlantic pacific division relatively liberal longterm resident relatively liberal new residents; west south central east south central division conservative longterm resident conservative new residents. new england make interesting case: may migrant made region blue. whereas 26 percent people born stayed new england describe liberal — national average — 49 percent migrated do. may samplesize fluke (new england smallest population census division therefore largest margin error). still, make sense given much bluer new england become. vermont reliably republican state. outside new england, importance migration reshaping political coalition may fairly minimal. people live region grew up, we’ve mentioned, move tend adopt politics new home (or they’ve politics along). in census division new england, percentage liberal among native resident within point two among resident (after accounting move away division). factor may responsible changing tone redblue political map. still, extent migration mattered, probably contributing political polarization rather blurring country shade purple. fit idea proposed book big sort”: people increasingly living near politically likeminded. 18yearold south carolina might go college boston liberal political leaning stay south carolina she’s conservative. pattern selfreinforcing. liberal resident likely leave south carolina, mean higher percentage one remain conservatives. the big sort” hypothesis problems; it’s unclear causality works, example. 18yearold become liberal get california, inclined move california already liberal?

the failure american health care act,2017-03-19,"from time enacted, american disliked patient protection affordable care act, also known obamacare. republicans, promising repeal replace obamacare, rode wave public dissatisfaction repeated election victories. gop took house representative 2010, senate 2014, white house 2016, largely capitalizing skyrocketing premiums, rising deductibles, disappearing choice characterize obamacare. now, republican control congress white house, finally chance deliver promise. minute soon. mandate obamacare place health insurance sent health insurance system death spiral. premium continue soar insurance company pulling market, leaving consumer fewer fewer affordable choices. third nation counties, individual one insurance plan choice. soon, many county plan available. repealing replacing obamacare longer option. essential. answering alarm, march 6 house leadership unveiled american health care act, attempt repeal replace. advocate health care freedom little reason pleased. american health care act little stop death spiral underway. may even accelerate it. here why. a major force behind death spiral series mandate obamacare place health insurance sold u.s. company offer insurance acacompliant suffer penalties, individual buy policy. for example, 10 essential benefits, including maternity care, mental health care, chemical dependency rehab, vision dental care child 18—which insurance must provide, regardless need desire health plan customer. make insurance much expensive would otherwise people dont want need benefits. but mandate contributes greatest way making premium unaffordable called guaranteed issue/community rating. requirement insurance provider accept people currently sick preexisting conditions, yet provider allowed charge people differently sick dont preexisting conditions. order enough money risk pool pay claims, feature make insurance company thus charge younger healthier people much more, charging sicker older people much less. even worse, creates incentive people put buying health insurance get health problem, insurance company must sell cannot charge differently healthy. imagine auto insurance worked way. would reason buy got accident. imagine much auto insurance would cost. to deal problem, obamacare infamous individual mandate, penalizes people tax put buying health insurance. penalty isnt stiff enough young healthy people choosing take penalty rather pay expensive health insurance dont need. the american health care act effectively leaf obamacare mandate place. remove individual mandate, place threat 30 percent premium surcharge one full year anyone go without continuous coverage 63 day (which sound lot like republican version individual mandate). obamacare make individual mandate penalty payable internal revenue service. american health care act make payable insurance companies. therefore, nothing american health care act address cause rising health care premiums, rising deductibles, insurance company leaving market. proponent say proposal increase consumer choice. long government designing insurance policy onesizefitsall mandates, never really choice. to fair, gop leadership argues arcane senate rule left choice leave mandate place. order avoid filibuster democrats, republican forced use procedure called budget reconciliation. otherwise, reason, nothing clear congress head president desk signature. budget reconciliation process allow address mandates. however, serious analyst argue that, based upon information provided nonpartisan congressional budget office, mandate reform indeed included part budget reconciliation package. cautious house senate leadership seem unconvinced arguments. the architect american health care act reassure critic secretary health human service tom price address mandate problem call phase 2 obamacare repeal/replace, act (phase 1) passed. point affordable care act delegated extensive administrative authority hhs secretary. refuse specify, however, secretary fix administratively. moreover, constitutional law professor josh blackman argues power secretary severely limited come matter essential benefit guaranteed issue/community rating. to help people deal exorbitant insurance premium resulting mandates, obamacare provided meanstested subsidy many people. subsidy paid directly insurance company order reduce premium price consumer. american health care act end subsidies. place offer ageadjusted, meanstested, refundable tax credit (meaning credit given people even pay net income tax) that, again, paid directly insurance company lower premium. amount nothing renaming subsidy tax credit make sound republican. entitlement created obamacare subsidy still remains slightly different form. to sure, good thing american health care act. remove (but all) tax obamacare drag economic growth, investment, job creation. act also remove mandate employer 50 fulltime worker (defined 30 hour per week) provide acacompliant health insurance. stifled fulltime job growth increasing number parttime workers. the expansion health saving account also laudable feature. empowers patient use money make health care decisions. a major step right direction act block granting medicaid funding state also allowing state innovate design program free washington micromanagement. fiscal conservative issue way structured. example, allows medicaid extended working, healthy adult (not original mission medicaid) 2020. nonetheless block granting constitutes major entitlement reform. gop leader promise make even improvement separate legislation (phase 3) allow sale insurance across state lines. result competition consumer choice, help drive insurance premiums. again, senate rule preclude matter included budget reconciliation bill. these thing nice, really dont matter: unless house senate leadership find way repeal obamacare mandates, none positive feature american health care act able stop individual insurance death spiral already well underway. and, fact, could argued removing hated individual mandate leaving obamacare mandate health insurance place make thing even worse. either way, come crashing down, republican succeeded wresting ownership disaster democrats. perhaps time gop leadership exercise raw legislative gamesmanship democratic predecessor used ram affordable care act 2010. example, within senate majority power declare repealing obamacare mandate germane budget reconciliation. senate republican even override senate parliamentarian disagrees. if republican task, then, cynical seems, might politically safer nothing, avoid blame crash, try rebuild ashes.",2,right,Reason,2017

a definitive case electoral college,2020-07-21,"one biggest problem american democracy it’s democratic. two last five president elected despite losing popular vote, half senate elected roughly 18 percent population, voting district increasingly gerrymandered way disenfranchise people live there. our process choosing president, electoral college, probably strangest explicitly antidemocratic feature american political system. conceived part firewall majority case mob ever elected someone grotesquely unqualified office. (it, uh, didn’t work.) but history complicated that. akhil reed amar, constitutional scholar yale, argued electoral college concession slave state time founding. another popular theory electoral college designed prevent presidential candidate ignoring smaller, le populated states. whatever case, there’s denying electoral college antidemocratic. according democratic data scientist david shor, electoral college bias realistically [democrats] win 3.5 4 percent order win presidential elections.” still around? purpose serve today? importantly, get rid it? jesse wegman, editorial board member new york times, made pretty definitive case electoral college book let people pick president. among things, wegman argues electoral college creates false picture country reduced red blue state when, fact, united state purple country — american pay huge price upholding system doesn’t represent diversity. i spoke wegman shoddy origin electoral college, hundred attempt abolish reform failed, think u eliminate it. a lightly edited transcript conversation follows. sean illing you explain book slipshod hurried process conceiving electoral college was. one really believed much cobbled together last minute adopted every idea failed win enough support. justifiable reason creating first place? jesse wegman you certainly look thing framers’ perspective say it’s understandable concerned elect president. never done before. building whole cloth concern real. one major concern many delegate didn’t want congress involved electing president since created system built separation powers. another concern citizen would never able make informed decision national candidate wouldn’t information needed, given nature communication technology back then. sean illing what would say foremost reason created electoral college? jesse wegman i don’t think foremost purpose. said, scrambling get thing done debated endlessly something like 21 days. none proposals, like national popular vote, enough support get constitution. but i’d say driving force get constitution finished sent ratification. beyond that, main issue keeping election president congress’s hand ensuring elector made electoral college knew candidate could make wise decisions. and course immovable obstacle slavery ensuring slaveholding state didn’t unravel whole process. james madison said middle convention popular vote fittest way elect president,” south wouldn’t go it. say once. it’s clear founder knew slave state ton leverage. sean illing we know process passing flawed. know product brutal compromises. electoral college ever operated way intended operate? jesse wegman no — possible exception first two election george washington ticket. that, basically elector operating framer thought best interest country. elector party hacks. clear 1796, it’s clear today. elector never disinterested, neutral, wise men founder imagined. sean illing why attempt reform abolish electoral college failed? jesse wegman i think common reason one political party seen benefiting way. it’s almost always shortterm political calculus keep college alive. it’s rare it’s anything relating democratic principle notion what’s fair just. one think electoral college brilliant constitutional invention, it’s preserved year political reasons. sean illing okay, dynamic changed, right? electoral college benefit republican party almost exclusively. jesse wegman you’re right college typically leaned toward one party — true 2016 almost certainly true 2020. i’d also say it’s harder think say definitively advance election. republican 2004 election, electoral college actually gave democrat boost. 60,000 vote went way ohio, george w. bush would national popular vote 3 million votes, john kerry would’ve elected. advantage aren’t fixed. but yes, concede point you’re making: right now, electoral college benefit republican pretty clearly, split election much, much likely go republican candidate. sean illing a lot people hear sort objection electoral college think it’s sour grape liberal don’t like current outcome system. respond that? jesse wegman i’m upset anybody experienced preferred candidate winning vote elected. think violates basic sense majority rule means. would say people is, look trump’s tweet 2012 arguing electoral college disaster democracy. circumstance tweet election night 2012, early exit polling suggesting mitt romney might win popular vote lose electoral college obama. mere possibility that could happen triggered trump’s tweet, i’ll say sympathize. sean illing and it’s actually happened twice last 20 year democrat — jesse wegman right! i’ll bet amount money moment happened direction, would see exactly reaction side, that’s everybody gut feel unfairness system put person vote white house. the electoral college disaster democracy. — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 7, 2012 sean illing what would say biggest myth misconception electoral college? jesse wegman this idea somehow small state currently voice electoral college system, would lose voice popular vote, exact inverse reality. right now, small state voice they, like big state mediumsize state across country, battleground states. state matter winnertakeall electoral college scenario battleground states, state candidate spend virtually 100 percent time money trying win. there 13 state three four electoral votes. call small states. one states, new hampshire, battleground state. new hampshire get attention campaign every four year 12 small state combined. small state complete nonentity right now. sean illing what claim big city would dominate popular election? jesse wegman a factual mathematical matter, that’s untrue. biggest city country don’t come close enough vote swing national election. can’t even swing election governor states. new york city didn’t vote george pataki. los angeles didn’t vote pete wilson 1990. 50 biggest city country represent 15 percent population. even fairly big city 350,000 people so, roughly 40 percent vote go republican candidate — case it’s far zero. often rural areas, electoral math holds. and comparison, rural area america also represent 15 percent population, vote 60/40 favor republicans. big city rural america essentially wash every presidential election. idea big city would somehow suddenly decide president everybody else wrong math. sean illing a central focus book idea ending electoral college would change way candidate campaign therefore sort issue prioritize. big deal? jesse wegman it’s great question, think really get heart problem here. candidate visit state even region states, really see warping policy priorities. democratic republican candidate focus issue important to, say, coal miner pennsylvania auto worker michigan, aren’t issue country. campaign forced pay attention everyone country treat every vote equally important, popular vote election would be, would solve problem would fair country whole. issue like immigration reform, health care reform, background check gun — thing vast majority country supports, it’s hard get presidential candidate really get behind aren’t key issue voter battleground states. sean illing the common defense electoral college it’s kind lastresort firewall manifestly unfit president. now, obviously, current president prof useless firewall is, case, principle least, keeping electoral college grounds? jesse wegman no, it’s terrible reason. explained why: donald trump. ever candidate stopped think electoral college designed do, donald trump 2016. reverse happened. reality electoral college never really worked firewall unfit candidate it’s fundamentally partisan institution. 2016 election ought put end argument forever. sean illing there’s least one way effectively end electoral college without technically abolishing it. explain is? jesse wegman it’s called national popular vote interstate compact, it’s quite simple way using electoral college framer designed mean popular vote. it’s endrun around college, people like call it. draw constitution, give state almost total authority award elector however want. idea state join agree award elector whichever candidate win vote nation, state, state now. it’s elegant clever solution problem. sean illing do think reach breaking point status quo loses legitimacy we’re confronted genuine political crisis? jesse wegman people often say me, well, ever going happen? republican get board, they’re never going it.” everybody always reason explaining isn’t going work. think overestimate american people’s tolerance system majority rule violated repeatedly. happens 2020, think you’ll see much stronger push get compact passed state right either considering may soon. we’re moment people thinking constitutional reform way rarely do, there’s openness changing basic structure question basic assumption government works. way pick president one prime place new way thinking could really lead concrete change. support vox’s explanatory journalism every day vox, aim answer important question provide you, audience around world, information power save lives. mission never vital moment: empower understanding. vox’s work reaching people ever, distinctive brand explanatory journalism take resource — particularly pandemic economic downturn. financial contribution constitute donation, enable staff continue offer free articles, videos, podcasts quality volume moment requires. please consider making contribution vox today.",0,left,Vox,2020

(the case fatality rate, cfr, proportion death disease cause within group people disease.) the researcher also discovered huge variation case fatality rate age group. short, virus appears deadlier people passing decade. see trend graph: overall, researcher characterized 81 percent case mild 19 percent severe critical. one major caveat, though: data come mainland china. case fatality rate different outside china. at time, there’s also evidence asymptomatic cases. it’s possible discover cases, covid19 look le deadly. that’s infectious disease typically look severe they’re first discovered since people showing hospital tend sickest. disease modeler account undercounting case currently estimate overall case fatality rate 1 percent. a symptoms: fever, dry cough, fatigue common, thick mucus coughs, shortness breath, sore throat, headache le common, according china’s data. but picture might change data symptom emerge countries. example, yettobe published german paper looked country’s earliest confirmed covid19 patients. researcher found symptom small sample often resembled cold. two nine patient fever, seven cough, common symptom like stuffy nose, runny nose, sneezing. 3) i think covid19? if you’re highrisk group — age 60 underlying health condition — seek medical treatment immediately, let hospital health care provider know suspect covid19 showing up. otherwise, stay home call health professional, vox’s umair irfan explained: work local health department figure whether need get tested get treatment. doctor health official advise go emergency room symptom appear lifethreatening.” there’s good chance you’ll recover nothing rest fluids. need selfisolate sick avoid spreading disease others, including people home. here’s it. the cdc recommend several basic measure help prevent spread covid19: wash hand often least 20 seconds. cover cough sneeze tissue, throw tissue trash. clean disinfect frequently touched objects. stay home sick. contact health worker symptoms; fever dry cough common. don’t touch face. touch face. don’t travel fever cough. travel fever cough. don’t wear face mask well. guidance may change. stay informed, stay safe, vox’s guide covid19. and healthy, way help vulnerable people community. 4) coronaviruses spread? we don’t yet know exactly sarscov2 — virus cause covid19 disease — spreads, lot data mers, sars, respiratory virus move person person. that’s mainly exposure droplet coughing sneezing. so infected person cough sneezes, let spray, droplet reach nose, eyes, mouth another person, pas virus, said jennifer nuzzo, infectious disease expert senior scholar john hopkins center health security. rarer cases, person might catch respiratory disease indirectly, via touching droplet surface — touching mucosal membranes” mouth, eyes, nose, added. there’s also emerging evidence showing sarscov2 may spread poop — known fecaloral” route disease transmission. researcher lookout potential airborne transmission, too, there’s lot speculation whether inanimate object — like door handle — pas virus. in case airborne transmission, person would get infected directly inhaling droplet suspended air infected individual. fomites” — object transmit infection — droplet infected person would end surface another person touches. far, conclusive evidence that,” wrote megan murray, harvard infectious disease specialist, coronavirus explainer, although challenging prove one way other.” what know: research piling suggest people mild symptoms, symptom all, test positive covid19 disease. virus also appears present body high level early illness, people still going work traveling. we still don’t know extent people without symptom infect,” nuzzo cautioned. isaac bogoch, professor university toronto told vox, even case asymptomatic transmission infection, typically rare cases, every respiratory tract infection known humankind, people driving epidemic.” even so, virus spread people mild symptoms, might help explain it’s contagious. researcher currently believe one person covid19 generally infects two three others, would make new coronavirus transmissible seasonal flu, sars, mers. that’s social distancing measure important. 5) protect myself? buy face mask? in us, every health expert vox spoken said there’s little evidence support use face mask preventing disease general population. mask useful respiratory infection already want minimize risk spread others, you’re caring someone sick working hospital direct contact people respiratory illnesses.

(remember, iowa, assessment win mainly based poll — polls, course, wrong.) iowa amazing, outsize impact country it pretty weird: essentially, iowa caucus important media, candidates, political world broadly treat result greatly important determining win. play several interacting ways: the medium hype iowa results, branding candidate winner loser based performed there. winner get ton excited coverage, loser become afterthoughts. and, particularly multicandidate fields, winning medium coverage hugely important. donor activists, too, look iowa result judge whether candidate they’re supporting still viable. poor iowa performance likely mean fewer campaign donation endorsements, make difficult candidate stay race. voter state — especially trying make sense complex, multicandidate field — take iowa result (and medium coverage results) cue contender actually win. there’s better evidence win won, say longtime democratic pollster mark mellman. accordingly, poll result state change incredibly quickly iowa result sink in. caucus, across country people paying attention margins, say john norris, who organized several democratic candidates. candidate naturally take account, many invest huge amount time money try well iowa. result come in, candidate poorly often take hint quit race (spurred donor longer fund campaigns, medium outlet longer cover them, subsequent poll showing they’re performing poorly elsewhere). shrinking field process known winnowing. amplify other: behavior candidate assures medium caucus result really important, justifies even coverage iowa. it’s symbiotic relationship, say goldford. long candidate think caucus important, press think caucus important. vice versa. all dynamics, noted, also apply new hampshire (and, decreasing degree, state process continues). media, candidates, political elites, certain extent voter elsewhere act signal believe iowa new hampshire sending them. thats early state contest dramatically reshape nomination landscape long vast majority american people get weigh in. 4) thats pretty abstract. could give example iowa shaken past contests? the earliest case iowa changed everything littleknown former georgia gov. jimmy carter victory 1976 democratic caucuses. second time iowa went first, carter calculated there, hed get much medium coverage hed catapulted obscurity national fame. essentially camped iowa year, strategy worked like charm won. carter subsequent mediadriven poll surge helped narrowly carry new hampshire 11 next 12 contests, followed nomination white house. jimmy carter would say would never become president without iowa caucuses, say jerry crawford, longtime iowa democratic organizer working clinton campaign. iowa convinced people obama medium phenomenon barack obama, too, relied iowa first victory campaign hillary clinton 2008. day caucuses, trailed hillary clinton 20 point national polls. day there, shot within 5 point her. the result iowa validating us, say larry grisolano, consulted obamas campaign year. people became convinced obama medium phenomenon — candidate could attract votes. obamas win made surge within striking distance clinton national polls, far another important early contest, south carolina. iowa peculiarity played strengths, grisolano adds. don’t know would’ve turned started place advertisingcentric. even iowa winner doesnt end winning nomination (as mike huckabee rick santorum, two recent gop winners), caucus result shake race elevating them, rather candidates, prominence contest. the caucus exceeds expectation fails to. set expectations? do. but important understand every candidate affected equally caucuses. iowa matter primarily change perception political world. candidate are, large part, judged whether caucus performance meet expectation medium political elites. for instance, 2008 gop caucuses, mitt romney came second john mccain came fourth. yet romney portrayed big loser, since campaigning hard iowa seemed favorite win. mccain, meanwhile, hadnt really trying win iowa focusing instead well new hampshire, fourthplace finish wasnt interpreted stunning setback him. every candidate iowa opponent, opponent’s name expected, say goldford. caucus exceeds expectation fails to. set expectations? do. 5) bizarre way pick president. iowa granted much power? essentially, iowa moved caucus front line perfect moment. happened back 1972, democratic party overhauling nomination process give actual voters, party bosses, say. thats presidential nomination system know today — monthslong sequence staggered primary caucus every state territory — came about. (republicans adopted similar reform soon afterward.) but 1972 — first nomination contest reformed system — iowa democrat slated usual caucus unusually early date january 24. people offer various different explanation so: deliberate effort help favorite son considering running president, arcane party rule change required 30 day pas various state local events, even lack available hotel room de moines summer necessitated earlier state convention date (which necessitated earlier caucus date). whatever reason, iowa democratic caucus moved ahead new hampshire primary, traditionally nation first. people political community concluded, happened told u something at first, people outside iowa noticed cared, 1972 caucus result got little attention nationally. retrospect, george mcgovern shockingly democratic nomination, insider secondguessing failed predict rise concluded paid attention finished surprisingly strong second iowa. people political community concluded, happened told u something. told u weak frontrunner. told u energy antiwar movement, say david yepsen, former political reporter de moines register. savvy iowan party worked hard promote idea iowa early bellwether. democrat arranged event topline result could easily reported national press, republican moved caucus day create unified event would get lot medium buzz. tom whitney, state democratic chair, later told iowa public television: basically ‘74 elections, organized very, significant kind effort convince first candidate ought iowa national press going here, convince national press iowa candidate going here. so carter victory iowa general election werent great — ended great iowa, could claim kingmaker. future candidate party spent time money there, national press started regularly covering result major event. party insider voter early state began taking iowa result seriously, too. ever since, state party tenaciously successfully fought keep caucus first, helped new precedent set, brookings fellow elaine kamarck chronicle book primary politics. 6) everyone okay giving iowa much say? not all! many critics, including vox dylan matthews, argue iowa population unrepresentative country whole — state much white rural, fewer foreignborn people. others criticize caucus setup itself: event take long time, theyre scheduled specific time evening, there absentee voting past, depresses turnout could make even unrepresentative. (four five registered party member iowa vast majority independent voter usually dont show up.) i think [iowa] distorts process good way, say operative state furthermore, democrat dont even get secret ballot, mean social pressure could skew results. gop side, turnout recently dominated evangelical activists, many opted candidate lack national appeal, like huckabee santorum. and presidential candidate party long felt compelled voice fealty powerful interest group state, like big corn (though peverill squire convincingly argues procorn policy mainly driven congress, white house). finally, seems plain unfair lot people state iowa get power. caucus defender respond saying iowa skew result — positively. think distorts process good way, say crawford, hillary clinton organizer. thats iowa state retail campaigning oneonone interaction voters, rather simply big money ad buys, matter. voter shown dont follow prevailing national wind — theyre willing give littleknown poorly funded challenger chance, help ensure democratic contest overall. iowa level playing ground, say iowa gop operative eric woolson. iowa electorate pay attention whats going on. in case, every attempt supplant iowa failed, neither national party agree else first line, alternative way thing entirely. state tried jump line — like louisiana 1996 — contest boycotted (at iowa pol behest) deemed meaningless national elite press. eventually, national party accepted iowa new hampshire hellbent going first second — vast majority state didnt care much. party began harshly penalizing state tried move nomination contest early. accordingly, nobody even bothered try leapfrog iowa time around. 7) okay, stuck iowa going first now. tell itll affect year race. once again, lesson political world take away caucus really important — delegate end allotted. everyone anxious see actual iowa result measure expectations, help better understand actually win. theyll looking major things. in gop contest, everyone anxiously awaiting answer one key question: donald trump get people actually vote him? despite trump monthslong lead national polls, there still great deal skepticism elite him: perhaps poll overstate support, perhaps campaign doesnt good ground game, perhaps supporter arent regular gop primary caucus voter wont bother show up, perhaps electorate flock seemingly electable candidate last minute. if trump win iowa, prepare medium frenzy like youve never seen before since caucus turnout difficult pollster model since ted cruz perceived better organization trump, much political world long expected trump finish second, behind cruz. yet trump taken lead recent poll — perverse effect raising expectation him. now, second place finish would viewed disappointment him. come third worse, hell portrayed loser went pathetic defeat. manage actually win caucuses, hell debunk much skepticism mentioned above, prove wont vanishing contest anytime soon — unleash medium frenzy like youve never seen before. the iowa result big implication gop candidate too. since ted cruz led poll recently, loss would perceived serious blow candidacy. marco rubio, meanwhile, currently polling third place, thats people expect end up. rubio manages surprise people placing second even first, hell get huge amount positive buzz going new hampshire. somehow fall behind — especially another establishmentfriendly candidate like jeb bush chris christie pass — whispered doubt campaign competence vindicated, whoever beat momentum medium coverage buzz among elite week granite state contest. candidate entirely manages surge late iowa (as rick santorum 2012), expect major player next contests, too. meanwhile, democratic side, bernie sander suddenly surged iowa poll full year trailing clinton. since he long ahead new hampshire, he positioned seriously compete early states. come raised expectations. clinton win contest outright, sander movement could well fizzle out, could wrap nomination quickly. sander win either, though, even come close iowa, expect pitched battle two last quite time. (and unless martin omalley vastly exceeds current low singledigit percent support iowa, expect drop soon afterward.) the nightmare scenario clinton point — implausible — sander win iowa new hampshire. happens, political elite press mercilessly mock secondguess clinton campaign weeks. yet insider also understand state heavily white representative diverse democratic electorate overall. big question whether positive coverage sander get improve performance among nonwhite democrat seemed uninterested candidacy far — put test next contest, south carolina. it goofy way it, agree. absent clear alternative... if feel like needed decoder ring make sense that, youre alone. one sat designed bizarre presidential nomination system — indeed, even iowan admit one would ever sit design exact system scratch. goofy way it, agree, say yepsen. absent clear alternative process continues. candidate keep investing time money, medium keep giving saturation coverage results, political elite keep believing iowa matter — iowa keep mattering. this article originally published january 25, 2016. updated latest expectation candidate perform caucuses.",0,left,Vox,2016

cory booker’s new big idea: guaranteeing job everyone want one,2018-04-20,"sen. cory booker (dnj) big idea: give 15 local area federal money guarantee resident job. the federal job guarantee development act, announced booker friday, would establish threeyear pilot program department labor would select 15 local area (defined bill political subdivision state, like city county, group city counties) offer area funding every adult living guaranteed job paying least $15 hour (or prevailing wage job question, whichever’s higher) offering paid family/sick leave health benefits. the idea government job guarantee ensuring adult want employment get long history american politics, gained popularity democratic party sought embrace bigger ambitious economic policy wake 2016 election. booker’s plan essentially pilot version proposal duke’s mark paul william darity, jr. new school’s darrick hamilton, economist have, together individually, advocated job guarantee years, well current surge enthusiasm. recently, paul, darity, hamilton wrote proposal center budget policy priorities, highly influential leftofcenter think tank, clear sign idea gaining traction. booker’s bill even bigger step forward. the federal job guarantee idea demand taken seriously,” booker said statement. creating employment guarantee would give american shot day’s work and, introducing competition labor market, raise wage improve benefit workers.” the policy case job guarantee the idea job guarantee serf policy political purpose. on policy side, job guarantee would, theory, effectively end recession america. right now, u government’s strategy economy stop growing use combination monetary stimulus (in federal reserve cut interest rate buy billion dollar longterm bonds) fiscal stimulus (as 2009 stimulus package, blended boost spending temporary tax cuts). for variety political institutional factors, fed congress weren’t able enough 2008 2010 prevent unemployment breaking 10 percent, certainly weren’t able effect full recovery within couple years. returning normal unemployment rate took nearly decade, resulting year human misery lost wage gain healthier faster recovery could’ve delivered. job guarantee advocate argue plan effectively creates permanent form fiscal stimulus politician wouldn’t need scramble pas whenever disaster hits. instead, economy took turn worse company started shedding jobs, government would automatically soak anyone who’s laid give work. that, turn, would put money consumers’ pockets, boosting demand improving business’ prospects. know it, economy’s back normal. advocate argue policy could prove beneficial economic boom well. fruit economic recovery boom aren’t evenly shared, demographically. march 2018, 60.7 percent white people america employed, 58.4 percent black people were. once black men’s disproportionate representation prison jail accounted for, gap grows still larger. 2016, recent year data, mere 27.7 percent people disability age 16 64 employed, compared 72.8 percent nondisabled people. nor boom affect geographic area equally. still 337 county countyequivalents combined labor force 6.7 million people unemployment rate 7 percent higher february 2018. seventyeight counties, like yuma, arizona, still unemployment rate excess 10 percent. a job guarantee would, principle, lessen inequalities. people struggling region would guaranteed work without move. black american disabled american wouldn’t expected wait employer run white nondisabled people hire get chance. finally, advocate argue policy would lead increase wage everyone. that’s big benefit time unemployment low wage growth still sluggish. think way: walmart pay employee minimum $10 per hour; parttime employee aren’t guaranteed benefit like health insurance 401(k) match. if you’re parttime employee walmart, sudden get $15 hour, work full time, earn full benefit working federal government — wouldn’t you? and, knowing that, wouldn’t walmart try increase wage keep you? advocate say walmart would. empirical evidence side india, type job guarantee known national rural employment guarantee scheme function largely insurance system, offering source income rural farmer dry season. a group economist — uc san diego’s karthik muralidharan paul niehaus university virginia’s sandip sukhtankar — found job guarantee, estimate, increased earnings lowincome household 13.3 percent. ninety percent increase due higher wage increased work private sector, job guarantee program itself. just job guarantee advocate would predict, program bid wage everywhere. perhaps surprising result program increased wages, increased employment private sector. the political case job guarantee — challenge face the fact cory booker, rising star democratic party likely 2020 contender face considerable skepticism left due stance education wall street, endorsed experimenting job guarantee clear indication party think could political winner well policy advance. in wake 2016 election, liberal commentator latched onto job guarantee way forge crossracial workingclass coalition. need plan appeal to white wisconsin michigan voter switched obama trump black latino worker left behind deindustrialization. ideal plan would improve condition lowerincome american supporting americans’ strong intuition people work earn crust. a federal job guarantee universal—it benefit americans—and specifically ameliorative entrenched racial inequality,” slate’s jamelle bouie noted. the job guarantee asserts that, individual bear moral duty work, society employer bear reciprocal moral duty provide good, dignified work all,” jeff spross added influential centerleft journal democracy. if democrat want win elections, imbue trump’s empty rhetoric real promise: good job every american want one,” wrote bryce covert new republic. it’s time make federal job guarantee central tenet party’s platform.” a sufficiently big idea, however, job guarantee come risks. would expensive, one thing. paul, darity, hamilton’s plan, outlined cbpp, would cost $543 billion per year, estimate. context, rival size medicare, cost $707 billion year, size defense budget, total $622 billion. center american progress proposed modest $158 billion per year government job plan, wouldn’t actually guarantee job sought one, paul, darity, hamilton proposed. booker’s bill doesn’t estimated cost yet. second, it’s clear exactly participant job guarantee scheme would do. proposal somewhat vague point, mentioning everything child care infrastructure. booker bill leaf locality figure out. cities, counties, area would get chance apply program, department labor would required pick mix urban rural area try idea in. program running, vast majority job offered would public sector, participant need skill development would offered eight week training. position meeting list national job priority … shall include child care, care senior individual disabilities, [and] infrastructure activities” would encouraged, private sector employer would benefit work opportunity tax credit, benefit currently give employer thousand dollar toward wage hire veterans, welfare food stamp recipients, exfelons, people barrier employment. beyond that, bill doesn’t give many specifics. a job guarantee would ideally provide job nice could nixed economy improves program shrink size. pretty hard identify. job guarantee enacted recession, many enrollee became child care providers, happens economy improves worker find job private sector? wouldn’t tenable eliminate universal child care program economy improved. nor, program employed bus drivers, would make much sense cut bus routes. the booker bill requires program subject ongoing rigorous evaluation, would help determine wellequipped local government make kind distinctions. would welcome addition research literature, there’s past evidence suggesting program like struggle succeed. berkeley economist david card recently conducted metaanalysis 200 evaluation program meant boost labor markets, along fellow economist jochen kluve andrea weber. found variety impact different programs, one constant public employment program simply hired people directly performed worst. public sector employment subsidy tend negligible even negative impact horizons,” study concludes. pattern suggests private employer place little value experience gained public sector program.” one reason, suggested, program nothing help build skill would make participant employable. a job guarantee, though, would entirely different scale, booker bill would enable evaluation could determine effect like successful indian program failed effort card, kluve, weber studied. with donald trump white house republican charge house congress, it’s doubtful booker’s bill become law anytime soon. that’s really point. proposal, closest thing job guarantee bill congress rep. john conyers’s (dmi) humphreyhawkins 21st century full employment training act, named largely failed 1970s bill pushed civil right activist union enact job guarantee. bill fell short establishing formal guarantee, conyers since resigned congress sexual harassment scandal. booker put idea back democratic agenda, form could readily passed relatively minimal cost (given pilot program nature) democrat next power. that’s important step, one significantly improves odds idea part next democratic president’s todo list.",0,left,Vox,2018
