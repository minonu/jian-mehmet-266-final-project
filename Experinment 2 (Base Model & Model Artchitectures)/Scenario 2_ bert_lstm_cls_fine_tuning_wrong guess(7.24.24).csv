enough, ryan pledged american people—and house republicans—that wouldn’t run house speakership without endorsement house freedom caucus, decision run speakership beginning was, like many thing he’s

huge improvement ryan’s part. remains seen ryan implement actual structural reform house representative whatsoever, hasn’t time done that. he did, however, failing earn official endorsement house

migration isn’t turning red state blue,2014-08-29,"last week, new york times’s robert gebeloff david leonhardt published article, growing bluestate diaspora,” made case transplant blue state making red state purple. pattern played important role helping democratic party win last two presidential election four last six,” wrote. it’s fascinating hypothesis, it’s overstated, view. first problem predominant political trend past two decade consistently better performance democrats, instead greater polarization across partisan geographic lines. remember, gop control house representatives, plurality state legislature majority governor’s mansions, republican slight favorite take senate november. democrat done well recent presidential elections, republican take senate hold house, 2016 gop control senate 12.5 past 24 year house 18 24. we’re saying we’d rather republicans’ hand play. balance power country reasonably equivocal, tends long run. by contrast, trend toward greater polarization clear sweeping. it’s clear race house; far fewer swing district were, even accounting effect gerrymandering. it’s clear gubernatorial races, bear much stronger correlation presidential election race federal office. it’s clear race presidency. 1992, democrat bill clinton beat republican george h.w. bush, state — none — either candidate 20 percentage points. 2012, 18 them, 11 republican mitt romney. state (such west virginia colorado) switched party loyalties, part, red state gotten redder blue state gotten bluer; theory role played migration need reconcile evidence. but present challenge. might seem follow there’s mixing american across state lines, everything might converge shade political purple. seen opposite pattern instead? one part answer straightforward: interstate migration increasing. instead, downward trend since 1980s; fewer american (as share population) relocating across state line couple decade ago. the part little complicated. people leave area don’t necessarily resemble one stay. instead, there’s evidence migrants’ political belief mirror voter new destination. many people moving liberal state conservative state may conservative, may least end way long. people moving conservative state liberal state may liberal. of course, certain state attract certain type voter job opportunity change — north carolina’s research triangle, instance. time noted, number red state (such idaho south carolina) home many blue state transplant yet continue vote reliably republican. there’s little sign that’s changing. if anything, mover generally extreme political view natives: people moving west coast new england, example, liberal people grew there. thus, process intracountry migration could contributing political polarization rather making state purple. we get sense general social survey, national biannual poll conducted university chicago. g asks respondent rate liberal conservative. g also asks census division respondent live in, lived 16 year old. using g data, figure percentage people consider liberal among different groups: longterm residents: people lived region 16 remain now; former residents: people lived region 16 live different one now; new residents: people live region didn’t 16. this method imperfect: census division don’t overlay perfectly political regions, g doesn’t drill state level. also, although we’ve gathered data version g since 2004, sample size aren’t huge. still, data enough suggest people moving away region ideologically distinct continue live there. example, people moved away south atlantic region (which includes number fairly conservative states) liberal people moved away new england regions. despite fact 22 percent people stayed south atlantic division consider liberal, compared 27 percent american overall. instead, mover common new neighbors; liberal attracted liberal regions, conservative conservative regions. next plot shows, politics longterm resident correlate reasonably well politics new residents. the relationship isn’t perfect (the correlation coefficient .62), trend reasonably clear. example, middle atlantic pacific division relatively liberal longterm resident relatively liberal new residents; west south central east south central division conservative longterm resident conservative new residents. new england make interesting case: may migrant made region blue. whereas 26 percent people born stayed new england describe liberal — national average — 49 percent migrated do. may samplesize fluke (new england smallest population census division therefore largest margin error). still, make sense given much bluer new england become. vermont reliably republican state. outside new england, importance migration reshaping political coalition may fairly minimal. people live region grew up, we’ve mentioned, move tend adopt politics new home (or they’ve politics along). in census division new england, percentage liberal among native resident within point two among resident (after accounting move away division). factor may responsible changing tone redblue political map. still, extent migration mattered, probably contributing political polarization rather blurring country shade purple. fit idea proposed book big sort”: people increasingly living near politically likeminded. 18yearold south carolina might go college boston liberal political leaning stay south carolina she’s conservative. pattern selfreinforcing. liberal resident likely leave south carolina, mean higher percentage one remain conservatives. the big sort” hypothesis problems; it’s unclear causality works, example. 18yearold become liberal get california, inclined move california already liberal?

(graph courtesy empire center.) this thing get murky involved. mcmahon wasnt presenting analysis true correct one — merely demonstrating question whats best applestoapples comparison profoundly change result. public discourse often treat analysis like objective relatively unique way, end definitive numbers. analytical plumbing produce number inevitably involves lot subjective judgment calls. when week spoke fed researchers, didnt find mcmahons logic crazy. (in fact, side spoke well others professionalism interviews.) disagreed. dont think inappropriate include orange county, jason bram, one researchers, said. yes, technically part new york metro area, urban erie county pennsylvania side. since casino openings, business decision involved, occurred period wage hikes, felt proper include well. fact theyre opening hotel number year ratcheting minimum wage, dont think thats something want ignore, bram continued. casinos, there also question whether knock entire county, whether simply realize spike end graph above, job growth new york side (the blue line) outpaces pennsylvania side (in red), probably artifact casino openings. you also take logic opposite direction: three county one knock out, more? pike county, pennsylvania side, distant exurb new york city, still exurb. erie county, far west end pennsylvania counties, account bulk job side, rustbelt industrial community others. remove pike erie equation, job growth pennsylvania side fall 3.5 percent 2013 2018. thats still 2 percent mcmahon found new york side; put tioga sullivan county (the one casinos) back in, new york rise 9 percent. remove orange pike, new york 9 percent pennsylvania 3.1 percent. remove erie, sullivan, tioga, 4.4 percent new york 6.7 percent pennsylvania. which version best version natural experiment? knows. starting remove county one considering small number county begin slippery slope, arindrajit dube, another economist who done wellregarded work minimum wage, told week. better recognize limitation single case study instead consider one additional data point rather sizable growing minimum wage literature. words, natural experiment perfect, better approach find many natural experiment possible, see pattern converges. in respect, worth noting dube involved comprehensive research regard. recent study coauthored, looking local result 130 minimum wage hike last three decade more, found fall job paying le new minimum wage fully offset jump new job paying it, washington post summarized it. dube also pointed another recent study, focusing 51 natural experiment since 2007 — also looked particularly rural area featured increase comparable disruption wed get national hike $15 hour. again, found discernible effect employment. meanwhile, recent overview congressional budget office concluded national $15 hour minimum wage would cause anything zero 3.7 million job losses. of course, thats big picture across whole country. local level, enormous potential variation. beyond that, everyones moral prior minimum wage pretty strong. moral focus preserving freedom business owners, higher wage workers? latter, much risk tolerate minimum wage hikes? interpret overall pattern study result light theory, say aggressive minimum wage hike natural experiment far provide? then there one final point mcmahon made, fed study might play politics. fed researcher clearly intended post interesting, admittedly crude, intellectual exercise — one might hopefully turn far sophisticated comprehensive study future. mcmahon worried qualification would get flattened study treated wider discourse. instead acknowledgement analysis one imperfect data point among many, itll federal reserve say minimum wage make difference, said. thing could half life easily decade. how economic researcher calculate release work public consumption difficult question. weve entered strange new era everything crude working paper finely polished peerreviewed study get picked reporters, scribblers, activists, politicians. rest u discourse definitely responsibility try put thing context. i strong opinion minimum wage policy myself. consider column least one effort meet responsibility. want essential commentary analysis like delivered straight inbox? sign week today best article newsletter here.",1,center,The Week - News,2019

jesse wegman i don’t think foremost purpose. said, scrambling get thing done debated endlessly something like 21 days. none proposals, like national popular vote, enough support get constitution. but i’d say driving force get constitution finished sent ratification. beyond that, main issue keeping election president congress’s hand ensuring elector made electoral college knew candidate could make wise decisions. and course immovable obstacle slavery ensuring slaveholding state didn’t unravel whole process. james madison said middle convention popular vote fittest way elect president,” south wouldn’t go it. say once. it’s clear founder knew slave state ton leverage. sean illing we know process passing flawed. know product brutal compromises. electoral college ever operated way intended operate?

why iowa caucus matter? everyone think do.,2016-01-25,"donald trump dominated gop presidential race seven months. nothing — many offensive comments, mediocre debate performances, oncefeared gop establishment — able stop rise. but february 1, could change trump face far biggest challenge yet: iowa caucuses. the result iowa — first time state actual voter weigh in presidential nomination contest — make national contest turn dime. barack obama iowa 2008, suddenly shot become competitive hillary clinton national polls. john kerry came nowhere win iowa 2004, presumed leader, howard dean, collapsed astonishing speed. and trump could vulnerable iowa. taken lead recent polls, anecdotal report suggesting trump ground game — crucial lowturnout caucus — laughably inferior ted cruzs. first contest really counts, trump could end loser. yet manages pull win — watch out. but let step back minute, ask: quirky iowa caucus tremendous impact race, anyway? what difference first place third place iowa going be, 4,000 votes? like student body election. the state small. population overwhelmingly white. turnout caucus absurdly low. democrat dont even get secret ballot. vanishingly delegate actually determine party nominee national convention iowa. care much wins? a ill explain, iowa became super important — media, party insiders, activists, candidate themselves, even voter extent — gradually decided make important. key player think caucus result reveal great deal candidate win election elsewhere, contest iowa isnt really contest delegate — contest look good eyes. but iowa prominence make sense? could obsession result medium insider alike tremendous overreaction, bordering bizarre mass delusion — one could end distorting get nominated president? what difference first place third place iowa going be, 4,000 votes? like student body election, say stuart stevens, mitt romneys chief strategist 2012. you respect absurdity it, continues. itll drive crazy. 1) iowa caucuses? the iowa caucus first time actual voter across u state get go say want president. and voter literally get go — inperson event, held specific time evening, one 1,681 precinct across state. there absentee voting, youre bedridden state, youve historically luck. (however, year, first time, party letting outofstate member military participate web, democrat making allowance iowan might trouble showing up.) the caucus administered separately major party, republican democrat quite different rules. year, gop contest simple: opening rigmarole caucus sites, ordinary secret ballot vote presidential candidate conducted, total tallied statewide. it kind like carnival, candidate supporter say, come us! the democratic caucus far complicated — theyre rowdy, hourslong public affairs, backandforth debate among attendee go physically stand supporter preferred candidate. kind like carnival, candidate supporter say, come us, group! say drake university political scientist dennis goldford. there secret ballot, democratic candidate doesnt get enough supporter precinct (15 percent attendees), eliminated, reality show style. here video showing one precinct caucus went 2008: 2) care win iowa caucuses? like not, iowa result appear hugely important determining major parties’ presidential nominee — particularly considered alongside impact fellow early state new hampshire. it’s remotely national primary. national poll mean nothing. nation isnt voting, say stevens. instead, iowan get first say. every winner competitive major party presidential nomination contest since 1980 except one started winning iowa caucuses, new hampshire primary, both. both recent president — barack obama george w. bush — kicked primary season winning iowa (and survived subsequent loss new hampshire). and, importantly, even iowa victor doesn’t end winning nomination end, state’s result dramatically shake presidential contest — knocking candidate race entirely, elevating others toptier status eye political elite future voters. you think number people participate — usually little 100,000 people per party, meaning around 20 percent eligible caucusgoers — iowa amazing, outsize impact country, say democratic pollster stan greenberg. 3) why, exactly, smalltime contest affect larger race much? like i, political world obsessed question actually win presidential nomination race. large part world come believe caucus outcome help shed important light question. (remember, iowa, assessment win mainly based poll — polls, course, wrong.) iowa amazing, outsize impact country it pretty weird: essentially, iowa caucus important media, candidates, political world broadly treat result greatly important determining win. play several interacting ways: the medium hype iowa results, branding candidate winner loser based performed there. winner get ton excited coverage, loser become afterthoughts. and, particularly multicandidate fields, winning medium coverage hugely important. donor activists, too, look iowa result judge whether candidate they’re supporting still viable. poor iowa performance likely mean fewer campaign donation endorsements, make difficult candidate stay race. voter state — especially trying make sense complex, multicandidate field — take iowa result (and medium coverage results) cue contender actually win. there’s better evidence win won, say longtime democratic pollster mark mellman. accordingly, poll result state change incredibly quickly iowa result sink in. caucus, across country people paying attention margins, say john norris, who organized several democratic candidates. candidate naturally take account, many invest huge amount time money try well iowa. result come in, candidate poorly often take hint quit race (spurred donor longer fund campaigns, medium outlet longer cover them, subsequent poll showing they’re performing poorly elsewhere). shrinking field process known winnowing. amplify other: behavior candidate assures medium caucus result really important, justifies even coverage iowa. it’s symbiotic relationship, say goldford. long candidate think caucus important, press think caucus important. vice versa. all dynamics, noted, also apply new hampshire (and, decreasing degree, state process continues). media, candidates, political elites, certain extent voter elsewhere act signal believe iowa new hampshire sending them. thats early state contest dramatically reshape nomination landscape long vast majority american people get weigh in. 4) thats pretty abstract. could give example iowa shaken past contests? the earliest case iowa changed everything littleknown former georgia gov. jimmy carter victory 1976 democratic caucuses. second time iowa went first, carter calculated there, hed get much medium coverage hed catapulted obscurity national fame. essentially camped iowa year, strategy worked like charm won. carter subsequent mediadriven poll surge helped narrowly carry new hampshire 11 next 12 contests, followed nomination white house. jimmy carter would say would never become president without iowa caucuses, say jerry crawford, longtime iowa democratic organizer working clinton campaign. iowa convinced people obama medium phenomenon barack obama, too, relied iowa first victory campaign hillary clinton 2008. day caucuses, trailed hillary clinton 20 point national polls. day there, shot within 5 point her. the result iowa validating us, say larry grisolano, consulted obamas campaign year. people became convinced obama medium phenomenon — candidate could attract votes. obamas win made surge within striking distance clinton national polls, far another important early contest, south carolina. iowa peculiarity played strengths, grisolano adds. don’t know would’ve turned started place advertisingcentric. even iowa winner doesnt end winning nomination (as mike huckabee rick santorum, two recent gop winners), caucus result shake race elevating them, rather candidates, prominence contest. the caucus exceeds expectation fails to. set expectations? do. but important understand every candidate affected equally caucuses. iowa matter primarily change perception political world. candidate are, large part, judged whether caucus performance meet expectation medium political elites. for instance, 2008 gop caucuses, mitt romney came second john mccain came fourth. yet romney portrayed big loser, since campaigning hard iowa seemed favorite win. mccain, meanwhile, hadnt really trying win iowa focusing instead well new hampshire, fourthplace finish wasnt interpreted stunning setback him. every candidate iowa opponent, opponent’s name expected, say goldford. caucus exceeds expectation fails to. set expectations? do. 5) bizarre way pick president. iowa granted much power? essentially, iowa moved caucus front line perfect moment. happened back 1972, democratic party overhauling nomination process give actual voters, party bosses, say. thats presidential nomination system know today — monthslong sequence staggered primary caucus every state territory — came about. (republicans adopted similar reform soon afterward.) but 1972 — first nomination contest reformed system — iowa democrat slated usual caucus unusually early date january 24. people offer various different explanation so: deliberate effort help favorite son considering running president, arcane party rule change required 30 day pas various state local events, even lack available hotel room de moines summer necessitated earlier state convention date (which necessitated earlier caucus date). whatever reason, iowa democratic caucus moved ahead new hampshire primary, traditionally nation first. people political community concluded, happened told u something at first, people outside iowa noticed cared, 1972 caucus result got little attention nationally. retrospect, george mcgovern shockingly democratic nomination, insider secondguessing failed predict rise concluded paid attention finished surprisingly strong second iowa. people political community concluded, happened told u something. told u weak frontrunner. told u energy antiwar movement, say david yepsen, former political reporter de moines register. savvy iowan party worked hard promote idea iowa early bellwether. democrat arranged event topline result could easily reported national press, republican moved caucus day create unified event would get lot medium buzz. tom whitney, state democratic chair, later told iowa public television: basically ‘74 elections, organized very, significant kind effort convince first candidate ought iowa national press going here, convince national press iowa candidate going here. so carter victory iowa general election werent great — ended great iowa, could claim kingmaker. future candidate party spent time money there, national press started regularly covering result major event. party insider voter early state began taking iowa result seriously, too. ever since, state party tenaciously successfully fought keep caucus first, helped new precedent set, brookings fellow elaine kamarck chronicle book primary politics. 6) everyone okay giving iowa much say? not all! many critics, including vox dylan matthews, argue iowa population unrepresentative country whole — state much white rural, fewer foreignborn people. others criticize caucus setup itself: event take long time, theyre scheduled specific time evening, there absentee voting past, depresses turnout could make even unrepresentative. (four five registered party member iowa vast majority independent voter usually dont show up.) i think [iowa] distorts process good way, say operative state furthermore, democrat dont even get secret ballot, mean social pressure could skew results. gop side, turnout recently dominated evangelical activists, many opted candidate lack national appeal, like huckabee santorum. and presidential candidate party long felt compelled voice fealty powerful interest group state, like big corn (though peverill squire convincingly argues procorn policy mainly driven congress, white house). finally, seems plain unfair lot people state iowa get power. caucus defender respond saying iowa skew result — positively. think distorts process good way, say crawford, hillary clinton organizer. thats iowa state retail campaigning oneonone interaction voters, rather simply big money ad buys, matter. voter shown dont follow prevailing national wind — theyre willing give littleknown poorly funded challenger chance, help ensure democratic contest overall. iowa level playing ground, say iowa gop operative eric woolson. iowa electorate pay attention whats going on. in case, every attempt supplant iowa failed, neither national party agree else first line, alternative way thing entirely. state tried jump line — like louisiana 1996 — contest boycotted (at iowa pol behest) deemed meaningless national elite press. eventually, national party accepted iowa new hampshire hellbent going first second — vast majority state didnt care much. party began harshly penalizing state tried move nomination contest early. accordingly, nobody even bothered try leapfrog iowa time around. 7) okay, stuck iowa going first now. tell itll affect year race. once again, lesson political world take away caucus really important — delegate end allotted. everyone anxious see actual iowa result measure expectations, help better understand actually win. theyll looking major things. in gop contest, everyone anxiously awaiting answer one key question: donald trump get people actually vote him? despite trump monthslong lead national polls, there still great deal skepticism elite him: perhaps poll overstate support, perhaps campaign doesnt good ground game, perhaps supporter arent regular gop primary caucus voter wont bother show up, perhaps electorate flock seemingly electable candidate last minute. if trump win iowa, prepare medium frenzy like youve never seen before since caucus turnout difficult pollster model since ted cruz perceived better organization trump, much political world long expected trump finish second, behind cruz. yet trump taken lead recent poll — perverse effect raising expectation him. now, second place finish would viewed disappointment him. come third worse, hell portrayed loser went pathetic defeat. manage actually win caucuses, hell debunk much skepticism mentioned above, prove wont vanishing contest anytime soon — unleash medium frenzy like youve never seen before. the iowa result big implication gop candidate too. since ted cruz led poll recently, loss would perceived serious blow candidacy. marco rubio, meanwhile, currently polling third place, thats people expect end up. rubio manages surprise people placing second even first, hell get huge amount positive buzz going new hampshire. somehow fall behind — especially another establishmentfriendly candidate like jeb bush chris christie pass — whispered doubt campaign competence vindicated, whoever beat momentum medium coverage buzz among elite week granite state contest. candidate entirely manages surge late iowa (as rick santorum 2012), expect major player next contests, too. meanwhile, democratic side, bernie sander suddenly surged iowa poll full year trailing clinton. since he long ahead new hampshire, he positioned seriously compete early states. come raised expectations. clinton win contest outright, sander movement could well fizzle out, could wrap nomination quickly. sander win either, though, even come close iowa, expect pitched battle two last quite time. (and unless martin omalley vastly exceeds current low singledigit percent support iowa, expect drop soon afterward.) the nightmare scenario clinton point — implausible — sander win iowa new hampshire. happens, political elite press mercilessly mock secondguess clinton campaign weeks. yet insider also understand state heavily white representative diverse democratic electorate overall. big question whether positive coverage sander get improve performance among nonwhite democrat seemed uninterested candidacy far — put test next contest, south carolina. it goofy way it, agree. absent clear alternative... if feel like needed decoder ring make sense that, youre alone. one sat designed bizarre presidential nomination system — indeed, even iowan admit one would ever sit design exact system scratch. goofy way it, agree, say yepsen. absent clear alternative process continues. candidate keep investing time money, medium keep giving saturation coverage results, political elite keep believing iowa matter — iowa keep mattering. this article originally published january 25, 2016. updated latest expectation candidate perform caucuses.",0,left,Vox,2016

kristen orthman think primary campaign always win. astead herndon impact women, specifically, running? kristen orthman think need distance order fully formulate, don’t think there’s question electability viewed lens probably hurt woman candidates. perception that, 2016, even though female candidate got 3 million votes, woman electable? said publicly would hear people early states. like, i’m worried beat trump.” don’t think sudden october like, oh, let’s make primary who’s going beat donald trump.” that’s it’s been. astead herndon i would largely agree. certainly, electability never far mind democratic voters. people tuned race, particularly around time late fall, shifted tone. policy idea took back seat electability question. candidate clearly articulated path victory started rise, elizabeth warren started fall. coincided rival candidate like pete buttigieg amy klobuchar increasingly casting warren’s campaign touch mainstream democratic party real general election risk. respond scrutiny, warren campaign try reposition unity candidate, someone actually bring side together. astead herndon there’s sometime unity candidate phase, feel like different fight heard before. kristen orthman mmhm. astead herndon square two version see year?

certainly, that’s gender. would add wasn’t woman win?” was, nonwhite nonmale candidate win? astead herndon last point, seems if, then, kind place we’ve ended, two people ideological poles, white males, inevitable? kristen orthman mean, maybe. don’t know.
