7. building progress but, first two month speaker—and history that—ryan veered away every single one these. suggests it’s highly unlikely ryan ever, speaker—because record—actually anything productive, despite claim will. $1.1 trillion, twothousandplus page long omnibus spending bill alone broke promises. despite ryan’s defensive claim establishmentright media—he’s appeared bill bennett’s hugh hewitt’s radio programs, refuse interview actual conservative like breitbart news, mark levin, sean hannity, rush limbaugh defend himself—the omnibus spending bill, breitbart news detailed, absolute disaster conservatives. funded pretty much every single progressive objective president barack obama’s effort fundamentally change america, even surrendered previous small victory ryan’s predecessor, john boehner, able secure, school choice voucher program washington, d.c. ryan abandoned effort promote conservative agenda” year ago. instead, ryan one central advocate republican party amnesty illegal alien wide open border massively increased immigration america. ryan, course, built giant fence around mansion hometown janesville, wisconsin, omnibus spending bill, didn’t provide funding fence united state border mexico—a fence provided federal law year yet built. ryan also promised preomnibus interview fox news’s sean hannity wouldn’t support cut muslim migration america. came house freedom caucus, according chairman, rep. jim jordan (roh), failed obtain commitment muslim migration backing speaker. that’s mention ryan’s close relationship rep. luis gutierrez (dil), progressive left’s champion illegal aliens. ryan also served one chief promoters—an architect, will—of obamatrade plan. helped shove trade promotion authority (tpa) fasttrack legislation—which aim grease skid 5,544pagelong transpacific partnership (tpp) globalist trade deal empowers sultan brunei potentially put american community risk succumbing sultan’s brand sharia law due sovereignty

coppins wrote one vicious inaccurate profile now2016 gop frontrunner donald trump—prompting trump call scumbag” expose lewd behavior toward woman working trump’s maralago resort—ryan took coppins church glowing liberal profile leftist rag. that’s mention ryan’s horrendous big picture spending budget deals. latest omnibus—which, again, ryan desperately tried defend kind win conservatives, everyone including house minority leader nancy pelosi know that’s true—is hardly first awful big deal. back late 2013, thenhouse budget committee chairman paul ryan negotiated budget deal thensenate budget committee chairwoman sen. patty murray (dwa). a breitbart news reported time, along analysis sen. jeff session (ral), ryanmurray budget deal increased national deficit least $15.5 billion. despite spending increase—again, hardly conservative principle—the deal cut veterans’ pension order pay funding tax credit united state government, ryan’s urging, wrongly paying illegal alien across country. ryan frequently also swooped last minute bail gop establishment effort spend taxpayer money. backed socalled cromnibus” late 2014, bill that—after virtually every republican promised campaign trail, including party chairman reince priebus—ended funding president obama’s 2014 executive amnesty illegal alien adult 2012 deferred action childhood (daca) executive amnesty illegal alien children. all that’s tip iceberg ryan’s anticonservative action congress—a taste what’s come keep following historical viewpoint pushing conservative agenda.” so, first new year’s resolution thoroughly debunked—he may end changing, conservative hope does, people don’t change—let’s look rest them. a gop unity,” ryan end securing support many house freedom caucus members—more majority them—he actually never earned official endorsement group speakership bid. gotten that, ryan would needed 80 percent group support house speakership race. ryan failed achieve that. interestingly enough, ryan pledged american people—and house republicans—that wouldn’t run house speakership without endorsement house freedom caucus, decision run speakership beginning was, like many thing he’s done, built abject lie. many house republican given ryan pas first couple month speaker. blame boehner lot problem conference, mess currently exists. again, ryan continues pathway he’s far, it’s hard see enough republican conference standing behind continuing support him. liberal wing gop conference, hand, likely continue push ryan support boehneresque kstreet goodieladen legislation—and divide almost certainly going split unity” ryan pushing for. ryan’s third promise new year—decentralized power” away speaker’s office—has, credit, seen advancement, although minor grand scheme things. ryan allowed rep. tim huelskamp (rks) onto powerful house steering committee, entity decides member get committees. senior conservative aides—chiefs staff senior aides—tell breitbart news ryan’s team much open boehner’s legislative process listening concerns. it’s really hard better nothing—what boehner was, bad he’d literally call republican member swear word even trying work conservatives—so it’s huge improvement ryan’s part. remains seen ryan implement actual structural reform house representative whatsoever, hasn’t time done that. he did, however, failing earn official endorsement house freedom caucus, walk closeddoor meeting group basically promise world. ryan promised he’d give five votes—which help speaker centralize power—the speaker steering committee; wouldn’t amnesty immigration bill president obama left office; pledged end retaliation gop member gop leadership, promised return regular order. during freedom caucus meeting, ryan’s plan way he’d run speaker house republican surrendered ability house rules—he wanted change rules—to bring floor what’s called resolution vacate chair. procedure—which conservative used successfully bring boehner knee force office—would forcefully remove speaker wasn’t fulfilling the conference elected her. rule literally put place thomas jefferson, founding father, america’s third president, author america’s declaration independence tyrant king george great britain 1776. good enough ryan, seems. he hasn’t given five vote speaker steering committee. broke immigration pledge inserting omnibus bill massive increase h2b visa allow guest worker america. hasn’t done anything prevent retaliation conservatives. hasn’t taken step back towards regular order—and fact used back room procedure block amendment legislation national importance, specifically flawed refugee resettlement bill ryan falsely claimed paused” obama’s plan resettle thousand syrian city town across america wake paris terrorist attacks. thing bill require three people serve pleasure president—the fbi director, secretary homeland security, director national intelligence—to sign president’s plans. ryan jammed bill house bringing floor closed rule—blocking amendment member house—then ryan proceeded fund entire program taxpayer dollars. that mean ryan already broken second half fourth new year’s resolution—regular order—and first half

migration isn’t turning red state blue,2014-08-29,"last week, new york times’s robert gebeloff david leonhardt published article, growing bluestate diaspora,” made case transplant blue state making red state purple. pattern played important role helping democratic party win last two presidential election four last six,” wrote. it’s fascinating hypothesis, it’s overstated, view. first problem predominant political trend past two decade consistently better performance democrats, instead greater polarization across partisan geographic lines. remember, gop control house representatives, plurality state legislature majority governor’s mansions, republican slight favorite take senate november. democrat done well recent presidential elections, republican take senate hold house, 2016 gop control senate 12.5 past 24 year house 18 24. we’re saying we’d rather republicans’ hand play. balance power country reasonably equivocal, tends long run. by contrast, trend toward greater polarization clear sweeping. it’s clear race house; far fewer swing district were, even accounting effect gerrymandering. it’s clear gubernatorial races, bear much stronger correlation presidential election race federal office. it’s clear race presidency. 1992, democrat bill clinton beat republican george h.w. bush, state — none — either candidate 20 percentage points. 2012, 18 them, 11 republican mitt romney. state (such west virginia colorado) switched party loyalties, part, red state gotten redder blue state gotten bluer; theory role played migration need reconcile evidence. but present challenge. might seem follow there’s mixing american across state lines, everything might converge shade political purple. seen opposite pattern instead? one part answer straightforward: interstate migration increasing. instead, downward trend since 1980s; fewer american (as share population) relocating across state line couple decade ago. the part little complicated. people leave area don’t necessarily resemble one stay. instead, there’s evidence migrants’ political belief mirror voter new destination. many people moving liberal state conservative state may conservative, may least end way long. people moving conservative state liberal state may liberal. of course, certain state attract certain type voter job opportunity change — north carolina’s research triangle, instance. time noted, number red state (such idaho south carolina) home many blue state transplant yet continue vote reliably republican. there’s little sign that’s changing. if anything, mover generally extreme political view natives: people moving west coast new england, example, liberal people grew there. thus, process intracountry migration could contributing political polarization rather making state purple. we get sense general social survey, national biannual poll conducted university chicago. g asks respondent rate liberal conservative. g also asks census division respondent live in, lived 16 year old. using g data, figure percentage people consider liberal among different groups: longterm residents: people lived region 16 remain now; former residents: people lived region 16 live different one now; new residents: people live region didn’t 16. this method imperfect: census division don’t overlay perfectly political regions, g doesn’t drill state level. also, although we’ve gathered data version g since 2004, sample size aren’t huge. still, data enough suggest people moving away region ideologically distinct continue live there. example, people moved away south atlantic region (which includes number fairly conservative states) liberal people moved away new england regions. despite fact 22 percent people stayed south atlantic division consider liberal, compared 27 percent american overall. instead, mover common new neighbors; liberal attracted liberal regions, conservative conservative regions. next plot shows, politics longterm resident correlate reasonably well politics new residents. the relationship isn’t perfect (the correlation coefficient .62), trend reasonably clear. example, middle atlantic pacific division relatively liberal longterm resident relatively liberal new residents; west south central east south central division conservative longterm resident conservative new residents. new england make interesting case: may migrant made region blue. whereas 26 percent people born stayed new england describe liberal — national average — 49 percent migrated do. may samplesize fluke (new england smallest population census division therefore largest margin error). still, make sense given much bluer new england become. vermont reliably republican state. outside new england, importance migration reshaping political coalition may fairly minimal. people live region grew up, we’ve mentioned, move tend adopt politics new home (or they’ve politics along). in census division new england, percentage liberal among native resident within point two among resident (after accounting move away division). factor may responsible changing tone redblue political map. still, extent migration mattered, probably contributing political polarization rather blurring country shade purple. fit idea proposed book big sort”: people increasingly living near politically likeminded. 18yearold south carolina might go college boston liberal political leaning stay south carolina she’s conservative. pattern selfreinforcing. liberal resident likely leave south carolina, mean higher percentage one remain conservatives. the big sort” hypothesis problems; it’s unclear causality works, example. 18yearold become liberal get california, inclined move california already liberal?

how state help trump make federalism great again,2017-01-18,"outside supreme court, december 2013 (reuters photo: jonathan ernst) state attorney general work together roll back federal government’s overreach. over last eight years, two dozen state attorney general mustered veritable legal army thwart unconstitutional overreach obama presidency. change administrations, however, elite force disband, rather must retool. trump white house succeed restoring constitutional governance, need support, cooperation, sometimes pressure states. advertisement advertisement in short term, state attorney general coordinate incoming justice department identify case appeal dismissed settled. further, legal officer roadmap congress president rescind unlawful executive actions. going forward, progressive state seek resist federal incursions, conservative state consider supporting principle underlying cases: state capitols, central government, decide local matters. precedent set period will, long run, entrench separation powers, ultimately promote individual liberty. the first order business state january 20, 2017, discus justice department status pending federal–state litigation. discussion help resolve, settle, number current case appeal trickling judicial system. practice limited stateled litigation. example, le 15 day left obama presidency, solicitor general asked supreme court reverse rare judicial victory second amendment. following precedent set obama administration epa case 2009, reflection, new solicitor general simply withdraw petition writ certiorari. advertisement rolling back regulation over next six months, congressional republican unique opportunity rescind regulation published waning day obama administration. congressional review act (cra), passed 1996 part contract america, allows congress disapprove regulation le 60 legislative day old. president agrees, regulation rescinded, agency permanently prohibited regulating issue ever again. salt earth code federal regulations. cra used — president george w. bush 2001 rescind inconsequential regulation concerning ergonomics workplace. now, republican unique opportunity kill bevy rule finalized following may 30, 2016 (counting backwards 60 legislative day end previous session). advertisement with respect cra, state help, big league: combing every page federal register since memorial day, attorney general identify every regulation warrant recision. regulations, though onerous, perfectly lawful. however, regulation violate federal law, intrude upon separation powers, flatout unconstitutional, jettisoned. need wait court act. provide even greater help overworked staff washington, state use sophisticated staff draft precise disapproval resolutions. further, attorney general use leverage lobby representative senator get disapproval resolution congested congressional calendar. president must sign disapproval resolution middle year, unique opportunity limited window success. advertisement for unlawful regulation cannot killed cra — either due lack floor time lack congressional — still hope. executivebranch agency initiate new rulemakings, announce upon reflection, they’ve determined old regulation contrary law, longer stand. assist process, state attorney general thumb federal register past eight years, flag arbitrary capricious regulations, draft proposed rule wipe obamaera regimes. support help relieve burden overworked executivebranch agency likely find little support entrenched bureaucracies. indeed, civil servant may even oppose resist incoming administration’s agenda slowdowns, leak media, flatout disobedience. finally, need it, state give direction president trump us pen phone (sharpie twitter?) systematically unravel president obama’s unlawful executive actions. litigating cause federalism advertisement advertisement advertisement beyond regulatory process, republican attorney general continue use elite legal team litigate cause federalism — even incidentally help progressive states. example, california recently boasted seek become new texas — like orange new black — rely principle federalism resist incursion trump administration sanctuary cities. conservative may oppose sanctuary city matter policy, federalist never lose sight fact state — central government — control local lawenforcement matters. (consider controversy effort justice department monitor police departments.) indeed, legislator austin currently debating bill defund texas municipality refuse assist federal immigration enforcement. right way handle sort issue. california challenge trump administration court, conservative state sit idly. unique opportunity advance cause federalism, process, benefit precedent set fairweathered federalist supreme court. first, california likely assert unconstitutional trump administration withhold federal fund sanctuary cities. once, once, supreme court held clawing back federal funding violates principle federalism. affordable care act (aca), state refused expand medicaid rolls, federal government threatened withhold medicaid funding. example, obama administration warned arizona stood lose nearly $8 billion federal funding, nearly quarter state budget. court observed across board, medicaid spending account 20 percent average state’s total budget, federal fund covering 50 83 percent costs.” words, state stood lose average 10 percent budget failing comply obamacare. aca’s financial ‘inducement,’” explained chief justice roberts, much ‘relatively mild encouragement’ — gun head.” pressure turned compulsion,” court concluded aca’s medicaid expansion unconstitutional. advertisement this precedent, however, mean every effort withhold money noncompliant state unconstitutional. congress routinely dangles aid encourage state comply federal programs. example, south dakota challenged law would withhold 5 percent otherwise available federal highway fund state refused raise drinking age 21. 1987, supreme court upheld law, finding congress offered relatively mild encouragement state enact higher minimum drinking age would otherwise choose.” however, amount issue miniscule. nfib v. sebelius, court pointed federal fund stake,” roughly $4 million, constituted le half one percent south dakota’s budget time.” if sanctuary city seek halt president trump’s withdrawal funding, amount fall somewhere 0.5 percent 10 percent, supreme court make new precedent. sufficient rely solely nfib v. sebelius. case, chief justice robert admitted need fix line” persuasion” coercion.” yet, rule trump, justice ginsburg sotomayor (who dissented nfib) go along new rule withholding amount money le issue obamacare case coercive. conservative states, rather waiting sidelines, gladly point court necessary departure nfib. specifically, flag federal programs, threaten withhold comparably small amounts, risk invalidation subsequent litigation. long run, unanimous decision put teeth spendingclause jurisprudence inures benefit red states. attorney general flyover country gladly hoist coastal fairweathered federalist petards. attorney general flyover country gladly hoist coastal fairweathered federalist petards. second, california may assert congress provide adequate notice changing criterion receipt federal funds. supreme court held congress intends impose condition grant federal moneys, must unambiguously.” federal government cannot surpris[e] participating state postacceptance ‘retroactive’ conditions.” like state opposing obamacare’s medicaid expansion, california could assert surprise[ed]” trump administration’s imposition ‘retroactive’ conditions,” transform[ed]” policy dramatically.” again, conservative state support fight, urge supreme court reaffirm socalled clearstatement rule. precedent would provide important precedent attorney general challenge executivebranch agency suddenly, unexpectedly, impose massive new condition states, without adequate notice. pointing implication ruling fairweathered federalists, conservative attorney general establish another important check federal power. to use contemporary example, department education recently reinterpreted title ix, 40yearold law prohibits sex discrimination educational institutions, require public school allow student use bathroom based gender identity. term supreme court consider validity new policy (if first withdrawn trump administration). west virginia, joined 20 states, filed brief urging supreme court reject agency’s rewriting federal law, imposed transformative condition states. supreme court would willing strike trump administration’s change respect immigration funding, obama administration’s dramatic change title ix cannot stand. advertisement advertisement third, california may resist effort cooperate federal immigration official — perhaps could even impede work. example, several city already refuse transfer federal government certain criminal alien lawfully present — ignoring socalled detainers — unless federal court order release. here, progressive rallying behind justice scalia’s opinion united state v. printz, held congress cannot commandeer state official perform firearm background checks. (ironically, gaggle blue state filed brief printz supporting constitutionality clinton administration’s conscriptive guncontrol law.) but another precedent california contend with. arizona’s s.b. 1070, commonly referred show papers” law, gave local law enforcement power arrest alien violation federal immigration law. supreme court invalidated provision s.b. 1070, finding stand obstacle accomplishment execution full purpose objective congress.” federal control immigration, court held, pervasive . . . congress left room state supplement it.” words, state immigration policy interfere comprehensive federal immigration scheme preempted. arizona allowed adopt policy arguably help federal law enforcement (by arresting subject removal), california certainly cannot adopt policy explicitly impedes federal law enforcement. precedent help sanctuary cities. (for irony, california filed brief supporting obama administration, opposing arizona.) there tension, however, two cases. printz, local official cannot conscripted enforce federal lawenforcement duties. time, state law policy serf obstacle” congress’s federal immigration scheme violates holding arizona. conservative attorney general cheerfully point tension courts. california prevail, supreme court shake thing up. printz’s commandeering doctrine expanded, thus reigning power central government; arizona’s preemption analysis curtailed, expands state’s internal police powers. rejiggering precedent would boon federalism. conservative state consider supporting principle court enforce president’s duty faithfully execute law. fourth, california may attempt sue trump administration’s failure enforce various laws. paradigm sound familiar should: texas challenged legality obama administration’s nonenforcement immigration laws, known dapa. suit, however, unprecedented. 2005, massachusetts (joined california) sued environmental protection agency failing regulate greenhouse gasses. supreme court held massachusetts coastline could eroded effect climate change, state sufficiently injured sue federal court. citing basis massachusetts v. epa, lower court held texas standing challenge dapa. (the supreme court ultimately deadlocked issue 44.) while california supported president obama’s illegal executive action immigration (filing brief support dapa), may keen trump administration decides exercise discretion respect environmental, financial, regulatory prosecutions. progressive state attempt challenge executive nonenforcement law — beyond context climate change — conservative state consider supporting principle court enforce president’s duty faithfully execute law. point sufficient merely reply massachusetts, need make new precedent — precedent could one day prevent future wholesale suspension immigration laws. fifth, blue state likely adopt powerful tool used red state reign federal policy: nationwide injunction. past three years, federal district judge (mostly texas) singlehandedly halted president obama’s unlawful policy concerning immigration, labor law, financial regulations. using injunctions, judge bound executivebranch official 50 state — even welcomed executive policy. example, california urged judge andrew hanen brownsville president obama’s immigration order allowed go effect state wanted it. dice, court held. advertisement soon enough, dynamic flip, federal judge san francisco, brooklyn, chicago, confronted request nationwide injunction halt trump administration. progressive reverse course, republican attorney general maintain consistency. often not, federal official overreach, rather underreach. nationwide injunction one remedy available quickly halt illegal action take effect — become entrenched. long president take executive action, especially outside formal noticeandcomment process rulemaking, court able quickly put hold violation law. policy attorney general stripe unwaveringly support. why federalism matter i pollyannaish. easy enough law professor extoll value federalism, ground, elected attorney general may face backlash actively challenge trump administration court. three important value guide important decision. first, donald trump president next four eight years. sooner, rather later, progressive white house. precedent established serve check havoc president elizabeth warren could unleash states. second, powerful value gaining buyin liberal justice — especially serve decade come — principle federalism. true, justice kagan sotomayor may able distinguish california’s present challenge texas’s future challenge — feebleness flipflops visible all. finally, importantly, state official take oath constitution, republican party. bear unique responsibility enforcing tenth amendment, dimensions: power delegated united state constitution, prohibited states, reserved state respectively, people.” mission reining federal government’s powers, restoring constitution’s separation powers, continue next four years, eight years, beyond.",2,right,National Review,2017

the failure american health care act,2017-03-19,"from time enacted, american disliked patient protection affordable care act, also known obamacare. republicans, promising repeal replace obamacare, rode wave public dissatisfaction repeated election victories. gop took house representative 2010, senate 2014, white house 2016, largely capitalizing skyrocketing premiums, rising deductibles, disappearing choice characterize obamacare. now, republican control congress white house, finally chance deliver promise. minute soon. mandate obamacare place health insurance sent health insurance system death spiral. premium continue soar insurance company pulling market, leaving consumer fewer fewer affordable choices. third nation counties, individual one insurance plan choice. soon, many county plan available. repealing replacing obamacare longer option. essential. answering alarm, march 6 house leadership unveiled american health care act, attempt repeal replace. advocate health care freedom little reason pleased. american health care act little stop death spiral underway. may even accelerate it. here why. a major force behind death spiral series mandate obamacare place health insurance sold u.s. company offer insurance acacompliant suffer penalties, individual buy policy. for example, 10 essential benefits, including maternity care, mental health care, chemical dependency rehab, vision dental care child 18—which insurance must provide, regardless need desire health plan customer. make insurance much expensive would otherwise people dont want need benefits. but mandate contributes greatest way making premium unaffordable called guaranteed issue/community rating. requirement insurance provider accept people currently sick preexisting conditions, yet provider allowed charge people differently sick dont preexisting conditions. order enough money risk pool pay claims, feature make insurance company thus charge younger healthier people much more, charging sicker older people much less. even worse, creates incentive people put buying health insurance get health problem, insurance company must sell cannot charge differently healthy. imagine auto insurance worked way. would reason buy got accident. imagine much auto insurance would cost. to deal problem, obamacare infamous individual mandate, penalizes people tax put buying health insurance. penalty isnt stiff enough young healthy people choosing take penalty rather pay expensive health insurance dont need. the american health care act effectively leaf obamacare mandate place. remove individual mandate, place threat 30 percent premium surcharge one full year anyone go without continuous coverage 63 day (which sound lot like republican version individual mandate). obamacare make individual mandate penalty payable internal revenue service. american health care act make payable insurance companies. therefore, nothing american health care act address cause rising health care premiums, rising deductibles, insurance company leaving market. proponent say proposal increase consumer choice. long government designing insurance policy onesizefitsall mandates, never really choice. to fair, gop leadership argues arcane senate rule left choice leave mandate place. order avoid filibuster democrats, republican forced use procedure called budget reconciliation. otherwise, reason, nothing clear congress head president desk signature. budget reconciliation process allow address mandates. however, serious analyst argue that, based upon information provided nonpartisan congressional budget office, mandate reform indeed included part budget reconciliation package. cautious house senate leadership seem unconvinced arguments. the architect american health care act reassure critic secretary health human service tom price address mandate problem call phase 2 obamacare repeal/replace, act (phase 1) passed. point affordable care act delegated extensive administrative authority hhs secretary. refuse specify, however, secretary fix administratively. moreover, constitutional law professor josh blackman argues power secretary severely limited come matter essential benefit guaranteed issue/community rating. to help people deal exorbitant insurance premium resulting mandates, obamacare provided meanstested subsidy many people. subsidy paid directly insurance company order reduce premium price consumer. american health care act end subsidies. place offer ageadjusted, meanstested, refundable tax credit (meaning credit given people even pay net income tax) that, again, paid directly insurance company lower premium. amount nothing renaming subsidy tax credit make sound republican. entitlement created obamacare subsidy still remains slightly different form. to sure, good thing american health care act. remove (but all) tax obamacare drag economic growth, investment, job creation. act also remove mandate employer 50 fulltime worker (defined 30 hour per week) provide acacompliant health insurance. stifled fulltime job growth increasing number parttime workers. the expansion health saving account also laudable feature. empowers patient use money make health care decisions. a major step right direction act block granting medicaid funding state also allowing state innovate design program free washington micromanagement. fiscal conservative issue way structured. example, allows medicaid extended working, healthy adult (not original mission medicaid) 2020. nonetheless block granting constitutes major entitlement reform. gop leader promise make even improvement separate legislation (phase 3) allow sale insurance across state lines. result competition consumer choice, help drive insurance premiums. again, senate rule preclude matter included budget reconciliation bill. these thing nice, really dont matter: unless house senate leadership find way repeal obamacare mandates, none positive feature american health care act able stop individual insurance death spiral already well underway. and, fact, could argued removing hated individual mandate leaving obamacare mandate health insurance place make thing even worse. either way, come crashing down, republican succeeded wresting ownership disaster democrats. perhaps time gop leadership exercise raw legislative gamesmanship democratic predecessor used ram affordable care act 2010. example, within senate majority power declare repealing obamacare mandate germane budget reconciliation. senate republican even override senate parliamentarian disagrees. if republican task, then,

a definitive case electoral college,2020-07-21,"one biggest problem american democracy it’s democratic. two last five president elected despite losing popular vote, half senate elected roughly 18 percent population, voting district increasingly gerrymandered way disenfranchise people live there. our process choosing president, electoral college, probably strangest explicitly antidemocratic feature american political system. conceived part firewall majority case mob ever elected someone grotesquely unqualified office. (it, uh, didn’t work.) but history complicated that. akhil reed amar, constitutional scholar yale, argued electoral college concession slave state time founding. another popular theory electoral college designed prevent presidential candidate ignoring smaller, le populated states. whatever case, there’s denying electoral college antidemocratic. according democratic data scientist david shor, electoral college bias realistically [democrats] win 3.5 4 percent order win presidential elections.” still around? purpose serve today? importantly, get rid it? jesse wegman, editorial board member new york times, made pretty definitive case electoral college book let people pick president. among things, wegman argues electoral college creates false picture country reduced red blue state when, fact, united state purple country — american pay huge price upholding system doesn’t represent diversity. i spoke wegman shoddy origin electoral college, hundred attempt abolish reform failed, think u eliminate it. a lightly edited transcript conversation follows. sean illing you explain book slipshod hurried process conceiving electoral college was. one really believed much cobbled together last minute adopted every idea failed win enough support. justifiable reason creating first place? jesse wegman you certainly look thing framers’ perspective say it’s understandable concerned elect president. never done before. building whole cloth concern real. one major concern many delegate didn’t want congress involved electing president since created system built separation powers. another concern citizen would never able make informed decision national candidate wouldn’t information needed, given nature communication technology back then. sean illing what would say foremost reason created electoral college? jesse wegman i don’t think foremost purpose. said, scrambling get thing done debated endlessly something like 21 days. none proposals, like national popular vote, enough support get constitution. but i’d say driving force get constitution finished sent ratification. beyond that, main issue keeping election president congress’s hand ensuring elector made electoral college knew candidate could make wise decisions. and course immovable obstacle slavery ensuring slaveholding state didn’t unravel whole process. james madison said middle convention popular vote fittest way elect president,” south wouldn’t go it. say once. it’s clear founder knew slave state ton leverage. sean illing we know process passing flawed. know product brutal compromises. electoral college ever operated way intended operate? jesse wegman no — possible exception first two election george washington ticket. that, basically elector operating framer thought best interest country. elector party hacks. clear 1796, it’s clear today. elector never disinterested, neutral, wise men founder imagined. sean illing why attempt reform abolish electoral college failed? jesse wegman i think common reason one political party seen benefiting way. it’s almost always shortterm political calculus keep college alive. it’s rare it’s anything relating democratic principle notion what’s fair just. one think electoral college brilliant constitutional invention, it’s preserved year political reasons. sean illing okay, dynamic changed, right? electoral college benefit republican party almost exclusively. jesse wegman you’re right college typically leaned toward one party — true 2016 almost certainly true 2020. i’d also say it’s harder think say definitively advance election. republican 2004 election, electoral college actually gave democrat boost. 60,000 vote went way ohio, george w. bush would national popular vote 3 million votes, john kerry would’ve elected. advantage aren’t fixed. but yes, concede point you’re making: right now, electoral college benefit republican pretty clearly, split election much, much likely go republican candidate. sean illing a lot people hear sort objection electoral college think it’s sour grape liberal don’t like current outcome system. respond that? jesse wegman i’m upset anybody experienced preferred candidate winning vote elected. think violates basic sense majority rule means. would say people is, look trump’s tweet 2012 arguing electoral college disaster democracy. circumstance tweet election night 2012, early exit polling suggesting mitt romney might win popular vote lose electoral college obama. mere possibility that could happen triggered trump’s tweet, i’ll say sympathize. sean illing and it’s actually happened twice last 20 year democrat — jesse wegman right! i’ll bet amount money moment happened direction, would see exactly reaction side, that’s everybody gut feel unfairness system put person vote white house. the electoral college disaster democracy. — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 7, 2012 sean illing what would say biggest myth misconception electoral college? jesse wegman this idea somehow small state currently voice electoral college system, would lose voice popular vote, exact inverse reality. right now, small state voice they, like big state mediumsize state across country, battleground states. state matter winnertakeall electoral college scenario battleground states, state candidate spend virtually 100 percent time money trying win. there 13 state three four electoral votes. call small states. one states, new hampshire, battleground state. new hampshire get attention campaign every four year 12 small state combined. small state complete nonentity right now. sean illing what claim big city would dominate popular election? jesse wegman a factual mathematical matter, that’s untrue. biggest city country don’t come close enough vote swing national election. can’t even swing election governor states. new york city didn’t vote george pataki. los angeles didn’t vote pete wilson 1990. 50 biggest city country represent 15 percent population. even fairly big city 350,000 people so, roughly 40 percent vote go republican candidate — case it’s far zero. often rural areas, electoral math holds. and comparison, rural area america also represent 15 percent population, vote 60/40 favor republicans. big city rural america essentially wash every presidential election. idea big city would somehow suddenly decide president everybody else wrong math. sean illing a central focus book idea ending electoral college would change way candidate campaign therefore sort issue prioritize. big deal? jesse wegman it’s great question, think really get heart problem here. candidate visit state even region states, really see warping policy priorities. democratic republican candidate focus issue important to, say, coal miner pennsylvania auto worker michigan, aren’t issue country. campaign forced pay attention everyone country treat every vote equally important, popular vote election would be, would solve problem would fair country whole. issue like immigration reform, health care reform, background check gun — thing vast majority country supports, it’s hard get presidential candidate really get behind aren’t key issue voter battleground states. sean illing the common defense electoral college it’s kind lastresort firewall manifestly unfit president. now, obviously, current president prof useless firewall is, case, principle least, keeping electoral college grounds? jesse wegman no, it’s terrible reason. explained why: donald trump. ever candidate stopped think electoral college designed do, donald trump 2016. reverse happened. reality electoral college never really worked firewall unfit candidate it’s fundamentally partisan institution. 2016 election ought put end argument forever. sean illing there’s least one way effectively end electoral college without technically abolishing it. explain is? jesse wegman it’s called national popular vote interstate compact, it’s quite simple way using electoral college framer designed mean popular vote. it’s endrun around college, people like call it. draw constitution, give state almost total authority award elector however want. idea state join agree award elector whichever candidate win vote nation, state, state now. it’s elegant clever solution problem. sean illing do think reach breaking point status quo loses legitimacy we’re confronted genuine political crisis? jesse wegman people often say me, well, ever going happen? republican get board, they’re never going it.” everybody always reason explaining isn’t going work. think overestimate american people’s tolerance system majority rule violated repeatedly. happens 2020, think you’ll see much stronger push get compact passed state right either considering may soon. we’re moment people thinking constitutional reform way rarely do, there’s openness changing basic structure question basic assumption government works. way pick president one prime place new way thinking could really lead concrete change. support vox’s explanatory journalism every day vox, aim answer important question provide you, audience around world, information power save lives. mission never vital moment: empower understanding. vox’s work reaching people ever, distinctive brand explanatory journalism take resource — particularly pandemic economic downturn. financial contribution constitute donation, enable staff continue offer free articles, videos, podcasts quality volume moment requires. please consider making contribution vox today.",0,left,Vox,2020

why iowa caucus matter? everyone think do.,2016-01-25,"donald trump dominated gop presidential race seven months. nothing — many offensive comments, mediocre debate performances, oncefeared gop establishment — able stop rise. but february 1, could change trump face far biggest challenge yet: iowa caucuses. the result iowa — first time state actual voter weigh in presidential nomination contest — make national contest turn dime. barack obama iowa 2008, suddenly shot become competitive hillary clinton national polls. john kerry came nowhere win iowa 2004, presumed leader, howard dean, collapsed astonishing speed. and trump could vulnerable iowa. taken lead recent polls, anecdotal report suggesting trump ground game — crucial lowturnout caucus — laughably inferior ted cruzs. first contest really counts, trump could end loser. yet manages pull win — watch out. but let step back minute, ask: quirky iowa caucus tremendous impact race, anyway? what difference first place third place iowa going be, 4,000 votes? like student body election. the state small. population overwhelmingly white. turnout caucus absurdly low. democrat dont even get secret ballot. vanishingly delegate actually determine party nominee national convention iowa. care much wins? a ill explain, iowa became super important — media, party insiders, activists, candidate themselves, even voter extent — gradually decided make important. key player think caucus result reveal great deal candidate win election elsewhere, contest iowa isnt really contest delegate — contest look good eyes. but iowa prominence make sense? could obsession result medium insider alike tremendous overreaction, bordering bizarre mass delusion — one could end distorting get nominated president? what difference first place third place iowa going be, 4,000 votes? like student body election, say stuart stevens, mitt romneys chief strategist 2012. you respect absurdity it, continues. itll drive crazy. 1) iowa caucuses? the iowa caucus first time actual voter across u state get go say want president. and voter literally get go — inperson event, held specific time evening, one 1,681 precinct across state. there absentee voting, youre bedridden state, youve historically luck. (however, year, first time, party letting outofstate member military participate web, democrat making allowance iowan might trouble showing up.) the caucus administered separately major party, republican democrat quite different rules. year, gop contest simple: opening rigmarole caucus sites, ordinary secret ballot vote presidential candidate conducted, total tallied statewide. it kind like carnival, candidate supporter say, come us! the democratic caucus far complicated — theyre rowdy, hourslong public affairs, backandforth debate among attendee go physically stand supporter preferred candidate. kind like carnival, candidate supporter say, come us, group! say drake university political scientist dennis goldford. there secret ballot, democratic candidate doesnt get enough supporter precinct (15 percent attendees), eliminated, reality show style. here video showing one precinct caucus went 2008: 2) care win iowa caucuses? like not, iowa result appear hugely important determining major parties’ presidential nominee — particularly considered alongside impact fellow early state new hampshire. it’s remotely national primary. national poll mean nothing. nation isnt voting, say stevens. instead, iowan get first say. every winner competitive major party presidential nomination contest since 1980 except one started winning iowa caucuses, new hampshire primary, both. both recent president — barack obama george w. bush — kicked primary season winning iowa (and survived subsequent loss new hampshire). and, importantly, even iowa victor doesn’t end winning nomination end, state’s result dramatically shake presidential contest — knocking candidate race entirely, elevating others toptier status eye political elite future voters. you think number people participate — usually little 100,000 people per party, meaning around 20 percent eligible caucusgoers — iowa amazing, outsize impact country, say democratic pollster stan greenberg. 3) why, exactly, smalltime contest affect larger race much? like i, political world obsessed question actually win presidential nomination race. large part world come believe caucus outcome help shed important light question. (remember, iowa, assessment win mainly based poll — polls, course, wrong.) iowa amazing, outsize impact country it pretty weird: essentially, iowa caucus important media, candidates, political world broadly treat result greatly important determining win. play several interacting ways: the medium hype iowa results, branding candidate winner loser based performed there. winner get ton excited coverage, loser become afterthoughts. and, particularly multicandidate fields, winning medium coverage hugely important. donor activists, too, look iowa result judge whether candidate they’re supporting still viable. poor iowa performance likely mean fewer campaign donation endorsements, make difficult candidate stay race. voter state — especially trying make sense complex, multicandidate field — take iowa result (and medium coverage results) cue contender actually win. there’s better evidence win won, say longtime democratic pollster mark mellman. accordingly, poll result state change incredibly quickly iowa result sink in. caucus, across country people paying attention margins, say john norris, who organized several democratic candidates. candidate naturally take account, many invest huge amount time money try well iowa. result come in, candidate poorly often take hint quit race (spurred donor longer fund campaigns, medium outlet longer cover them, subsequent poll showing they’re performing poorly elsewhere). shrinking field process known winnowing. amplify other: behavior candidate assures medium caucus result really important, justifies even coverage iowa. it’s symbiotic relationship, say goldford. long candidate think caucus important, press think caucus important. vice versa. all dynamics, noted, also apply new hampshire (and, decreasing degree, state process continues). media, candidates, political elites, certain extent voter elsewhere act signal believe iowa new hampshire sending them. thats early state contest dramatically reshape nomination landscape long vast majority american people get weigh in. 4) thats pretty abstract. could give example iowa shaken past contests? the earliest case iowa changed everything littleknown former georgia gov. jimmy carter victory 1976 democratic caucuses. second time iowa went first, carter calculated there, hed get much medium coverage hed catapulted obscurity national fame. essentially camped iowa year, strategy worked like charm won. carter subsequent mediadriven poll surge helped narrowly carry new hampshire 11 next 12 contests, followed nomination white house. jimmy carter would say would never become president without iowa caucuses, say jerry crawford, longtime iowa democratic organizer working clinton campaign. iowa convinced people obama medium phenomenon barack obama, too, relied iowa first victory campaign hillary clinton 2008. day caucuses, trailed hillary clinton 20 point national polls. day there, shot within 5 point her. the result iowa validating us, say larry grisolano, consulted obamas campaign year. people became convinced obama medium phenomenon — candidate could attract votes. obamas win made surge within striking distance clinton national polls, far another important early contest, south carolina. iowa peculiarity played strengths, grisolano adds. don’t know would’ve turned started place advertisingcentric. even iowa winner doesnt end winning nomination (as mike huckabee rick santorum, two recent gop winners), caucus result shake race elevating them, rather candidates, prominence contest. the caucus exceeds expectation fails to. set expectations? do. but important understand every candidate affected equally caucuses. iowa matter primarily change perception political world. candidate are, large part, judged whether caucus performance meet expectation medium political elites. for instance, 2008 gop caucuses, mitt romney came second john mccain came fourth. yet romney portrayed big loser, since campaigning hard iowa seemed favorite win. mccain, meanwhile, hadnt really trying win iowa focusing instead well new hampshire, fourthplace finish wasnt interpreted stunning setback him. every candidate iowa opponent, opponent’s name expected, say goldford. caucus exceeds expectation fails to. set expectations? do. 5) bizarre way pick president. iowa granted much power? essentially, iowa moved caucus front line perfect moment. happened back 1972, democratic party overhauling nomination process give actual voters, party bosses, say. thats presidential nomination system know today — monthslong sequence staggered primary caucus every state territory — came about. (republicans adopted similar reform soon afterward.) but 1972 — first nomination contest reformed system — iowa democrat slated usual caucus unusually early date january 24. people offer various different explanation so: deliberate effort help favorite son considering running president, arcane party rule change required 30 day pas various state local events, even lack available hotel room de moines summer necessitated earlier state convention date (which necessitated earlier caucus date). whatever reason, iowa democratic caucus moved ahead new hampshire primary, traditionally nation first. people political community concluded, happened told u something at first, people outside iowa noticed cared, 1972 caucus result got little attention nationally. retrospect, george mcgovern shockingly democratic nomination, insider secondguessing failed predict rise concluded paid attention finished surprisingly strong second iowa. people political community concluded, happened told u something. told u weak frontrunner. told u energy antiwar movement, say david yepsen, former political reporter de moines register. savvy iowan party worked hard promote idea iowa early bellwether. democrat arranged event topline result could easily reported national press, republican moved caucus day create unified event would get lot medium buzz. tom whitney, state democratic chair, later told iowa public television: basically ‘74 elections, organized very, significant kind effort convince first candidate ought iowa national press going here, convince national press iowa candidate going here. so carter victory iowa general election werent great — ended great iowa, could claim kingmaker. future candidate party spent time money there, national press started regularly covering result major event. party insider voter early state began taking iowa result seriously, too. ever since, state party tenaciously successfully fought keep caucus first, helped new precedent set, brookings fellow elaine kamarck chronicle book primary politics. 6) everyone okay giving iowa much say? not all! many critics, including vox dylan matthews, argue iowa population unrepresentative country whole — state much white rural, fewer foreignborn people. others criticize caucus setup itself: event take long time, theyre scheduled specific time evening, there absentee voting past, depresses turnout could make even unrepresentative. (four five registered party member iowa vast majority independent voter usually dont show up.) i think [iowa] distorts process good way, say operative state furthermore, democrat dont even get secret ballot, mean social pressure could skew results. gop side, turnout recently dominated evangelical activists, many opted candidate lack national appeal, like huckabee santorum. and presidential candidate party long felt compelled voice fealty powerful interest group state, like big corn (though peverill squire convincingly argues procorn policy mainly driven congress, white house). finally, seems plain unfair lot people state iowa get power. caucus defender respond saying iowa skew result — positively. think distorts process good way, say crawford, hillary clinton organizer. thats iowa state retail campaigning oneonone interaction voters, rather simply big money ad buys, matter. voter shown dont follow prevailing national wind — theyre willing give littleknown poorly funded challenger chance, help ensure democratic contest overall. iowa level playing ground, say iowa gop operative eric woolson. iowa electorate pay attention whats going on. in case, every attempt supplant iowa failed, neither national party agree else first line, alternative way thing entirely. state tried jump line — like louisiana 1996 — contest boycotted (at iowa pol behest) deemed meaningless national elite press. eventually, national party accepted iowa new hampshire hellbent going first second — vast majority state didnt care much. party began harshly penalizing state tried move nomination contest early. accordingly, nobody even bothered try leapfrog iowa time around. 7) okay, stuck iowa going first now. tell itll affect year race. once again, lesson political world take away caucus really important — delegate end allotted. everyone anxious see actual iowa result measure expectations, help better understand actually win. theyll looking major things. in gop contest, everyone anxiously awaiting answer one key question: donald trump get people actually vote him? despite trump monthslong lead national polls, there still great deal skepticism elite him: perhaps poll overstate support, perhaps campaign doesnt good ground game, perhaps supporter arent regular gop primary caucus voter wont bother show up, perhaps electorate flock seemingly electable candidate last minute. if trump win iowa, prepare medium frenzy like youve never seen before since caucus turnout difficult pollster model since ted cruz perceived better organization trump, much political world long expected trump finish second, behind cruz. yet trump taken lead recent poll — perverse effect raising expectation him. now, second place finish would viewed disappointment him. come third worse, hell portrayed loser went pathetic defeat. manage actually win caucuses, hell debunk much skepticism mentioned above, prove wont vanishing contest anytime soon — unleash medium frenzy like youve never seen before. the iowa result big implication gop candidate too. since ted cruz led poll recently, loss would perceived serious blow candidacy. marco rubio, meanwhile, currently polling third place, thats people expect end up. rubio manages surprise people placing second even first, hell get huge amount positive buzz going new hampshire. somehow fall behind — especially another establishmentfriendly candidate like jeb bush chris christie pass — whispered doubt campaign competence vindicated, whoever beat momentum medium coverage buzz among elite week granite state contest. candidate entirely manages surge late iowa (as rick santorum 2012), expect major player next contests, too. meanwhile, democratic side, bernie sander suddenly surged iowa poll full year trailing clinton. since he long ahead new hampshire, he positioned seriously compete early states. come raised expectations. clinton win contest outright, sander movement could well fizzle out, could wrap nomination quickly. sander win either, though, even come close iowa, expect pitched battle two last quite time. (and unless martin omalley vastly exceeds current low singledigit percent support iowa, expect drop soon afterward.) the nightmare scenario clinton point — implausible — sander win iowa new hampshire. happens, political elite press mercilessly mock secondguess clinton campaign weeks. yet insider also understand state heavily white representative diverse democratic electorate overall. big question whether positive coverage sander get improve performance among nonwhite democrat seemed uninterested candidacy far — put test next contest, south carolina. it goofy way it, agree. absent clear alternative... if feel like needed decoder ring make sense that, youre alone. one sat designed bizarre presidential nomination system — indeed, even iowan admit one would ever sit design exact system scratch. goofy way it, agree, say yepsen. absent clear alternative process continues. candidate keep investing time money, medium keep giving saturation coverage results, political elite keep believing iowa matter — iowa keep mattering. this article originally published january 25, 2016. updated latest expectation candidate perform caucuses.",0,left,Vox,2016
