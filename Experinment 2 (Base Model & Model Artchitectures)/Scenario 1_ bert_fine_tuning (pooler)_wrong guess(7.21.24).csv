one part answer straightforward: interstate migration increasing. instead, downward trend since 1980s; fewer american (as share population) relocating across state line couple decade ago. the part little complicated. people leave area don’t necessarily resemble one stay. instead, there’s evidence migrants’ political belief mirror voter new destination. many people moving liberal state conservative state may conservative, may least end way long. people moving conservative state liberal state may liberal. of course, certain state attract certain type voter job opportunity change — north carolina’s research triangle, instance. time noted, number red state (such idaho south carolina) home many blue state transplant yet continue vote reliably republican. there’s little sign that’s changing. if anything, mover generally extreme political view natives: people moving west coast new england, example, liberal people grew there. thus, process intracountry migration could contributing political polarization rather making state purple. we get sense general social survey, national biannual poll conducted university chicago. g asks respondent rate liberal conservative. g also asks census division respondent live in, lived 16 year old. using g data, figure percentage people consider liberal among different groups: longterm residents: people lived region 16 remain now; former residents: people lived region 16 live different one now; new residents: people live region didn’t 16. this method imperfect: census division don’t overlay perfectly political regions, g doesn’t drill state level. also, although we’ve gathered data version g since 2004, sample size aren’t huge. still, data enough suggest people moving away region ideologically distinct continue live there. example, people moved away south atlantic region (which includes number fairly conservative states) liberal people moved away new england regions. despite fact 22 percent people stayed south atlantic division consider liberal, compared 27 percent american overall. instead, mover common new neighbors; liberal attracted liberal regions, conservative conservative regions. next plot shows, politics longterm resident correlate reasonably well politics new residents. the relationship isn’t perfect (the correlation coefficient .62), trend reasonably clear. example, middle atlantic pacific division relatively liberal longterm resident relatively liberal new residents; west south central east south central division conservative longterm resident conservative new residents. new england make interesting case: may migrant made region blue. whereas 26 percent people born stayed new england describe liberal — national average — 49 percent migrated do. may samplesize fluke (new england smallest population census division therefore largest margin error). still, make sense given much bluer new england become. vermont reliably republican state. outside new england, importance migration reshaping political coalition may fairly minimal. people live region grew up, we’ve mentioned, move tend adopt politics new home (or they’ve politics along). in census division new england, percentage liberal among native resident within point two among resident (after accounting move away division). factor may responsible changing tone redblue political map. still, extent migration mattered, probably contributing political polarization rather blurring country shade purple. fit idea proposed book big sort”: people increasingly living near politically likeminded. 18yearold south carolina might go college boston liberal political leaning stay south carolina she’s conservative. pattern selfreinforcing. liberal resident likely leave south carolina, mean higher percentage one remain conservatives. the big sort” hypothesis problems; it’s unclear causality works, example. 18yearold become liberal get california, inclined move california already liberal?

why economics minimum wage increase tough measure,2019-09-30,"advertisement last week, several researcher federal reserve posted analysis minimum wage new york state. grand sweep research debate done minimum wage, blog post dispute kicked minor blips. microcosm grander debate, actually rather instructive. basically, trio researcher federal reserve branch new york spotted chance natural experiment. last years, new york state passed series minimum wage hike gradually phasing in: threeyear hike tipped workers, started 2013, $7.25 $9.00 hour; 2015 law raise fast food worker $15 hour 2021; 2016 law raise whole state $15 hour 2022. meanwhile, neighboring pennsylvania remains federal minimum wage $7.25 hour. since effect minimum wage job hotly contested — critic contend raise pay cost le employment — look county lie either side new yorkpennsylvania border, see performed? minimum wage hike harm employment, show comparison. the researcher wound looking two sector 2010 2018 — retail, leisure hospitality — across 10 new york county 9 pennsylvania counties. found earnings grew faster new york side. since minimum wage going up, thats surprising. whats important that, retail declining everywhere, set county declined essentially rate. meanwhile, leisure hospitality employment grew rate. essentially, found zero employment effect. (graph courtesy federal reserve bank new york.) it didnt take long conservativeleaning think tank, empire center, post critique fed analysis. the logic focusing county either side border that, right next other, presumably share similar regional economies. chance youre comparing apple orange — analysis thrown random event confounding variable — minimized. fed researcher sort assumed, well, border area theyre similar, e.j. mcmahon, founder research director empire center, told week. theyre actually similar, theyre different regional economies. specifically, mcmahon pointed two casino opened sullivan tioga county new york side. argued casino unusual enough business model — statelicensed gambling — including job create analysis minimum wage obscures reveals. also pointed fed inclusion orange county new york side problematic: exurb new york city, commuter city live there, integrated greater metro area public transit. county study rural, one widely agreed upon point minimum wage debate policy effects, whatever are, going different lowcostofliving rural area expensive urban ones. mcmahon also argued new york side bigger population economically dynamic across board. mcmahon reran number 2013 2018, removed sullivan, tioga, orange counties. found leisure hospitality job new york side grew slower pennsylvania side: 2 percent versus 4.5 percent, respectively.

purpose serve today? importantly, get rid it? jesse wegman, editorial board member new york times, made pretty definitive case electoral college book let people pick president. among things, wegman argues electoral college creates false picture country reduced red blue state when, fact, united state purple country — american pay huge price upholding system doesn’t represent diversity. i spoke wegman shoddy origin electoral college, hundred attempt abolish reform failed, think u eliminate it. a lightly edited transcript conversation follows. sean illing you explain book slipshod hurried process conceiving electoral college was. one really believed much cobbled together last minute adopted every idea failed win enough support. justifiable reason creating first place? jesse wegman you certainly look thing framers’ perspective say it’s understandable concerned elect president. never done before. building whole cloth concern real. one major concern many delegate didn’t want congress involved electing president since created system built separation powers. another concern citizen would never able make informed decision national candidate wouldn’t information needed, given nature communication technology back then. sean illing what would say foremost reason created electoral college? jesse wegman i don’t think foremost purpose. said, scrambling get thing done debated endlessly something like 21 days. none proposals, like national popular vote, enough support get constitution. but i’d say driving force get constitution finished sent ratification. beyond that, main issue keeping election president congress’s hand ensuring elector made electoral college knew candidate could make wise decisions. and course immovable obstacle slavery ensuring slaveholding state didn’t unravel whole process. james madison said middle convention popular vote fittest way elect president,” south wouldn’t go it. say once. it’s clear founder knew slave state ton leverage. sean illing we know process passing flawed. know product brutal compromises. electoral college ever operated way intended operate? jesse wegman no — possible exception first two election george washington ticket. that, basically elector operating framer thought best interest country. elector party hacks. clear 1796, it’s clear today. elector never disinterested, neutral, wise men founder imagined. sean illing why attempt reform abolish electoral college failed? jesse wegman i think common reason one political party seen benefiting way. it’s almost always shortterm political calculus keep college alive. it’s rare it’s anything relating democratic principle notion what’s fair just. one think electoral college brilliant constitutional invention, it’s preserved year political reasons. sean illing okay, dynamic changed, right? electoral college benefit republican party almost exclusively. jesse wegman you’re right college typically leaned toward one party — true 2016 almost certainly true 2020. i’d also say it’s harder think say definitively advance election. republican 2004 election, electoral college actually gave democrat boost. 60,000 vote went way ohio, george w. bush would national popular vote 3 million votes, john kerry would’ve elected. advantage aren’t fixed. but yes, concede point you’re making: right now, electoral college benefit republican pretty clearly, split election much, much likely go republican candidate. sean illing a lot people hear sort objection electoral college think it’s sour grape liberal don’t like current outcome system. respond that? jesse wegman i’m upset anybody experienced preferred candidate winning vote elected. think violates basic sense majority rule means. would say people is, look trump’s tweet 2012 arguing electoral college disaster democracy. circumstance tweet election night 2012, early exit polling suggesting mitt romney might win popular vote lose electoral college obama. mere possibility that could happen triggered trump’s tweet, i’ll say sympathize. sean illing and it’s actually happened twice last 20 year democrat — jesse wegman right! i’ll bet amount money moment happened direction, would see exactly reaction side, that’s everybody gut feel unfairness system put person vote white house. the electoral college disaster democracy. — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 7, 2012 sean illing what would say biggest myth misconception electoral college? jesse wegman this idea somehow small state currently voice electoral college system, would lose voice popular vote, exact inverse reality. right now, small state voice they, like big state mediumsize state across country, battleground states. state matter winnertakeall electoral college scenario battleground states, state candidate spend virtually 100 percent time money trying win. there 13 state three four electoral votes. call small states. one states, new hampshire, battleground state. new hampshire get attention campaign every four year 12 small state combined. small state complete nonentity right now. sean illing what claim big city would dominate popular election? jesse wegman a factual mathematical matter, that’s untrue. biggest city country don’t come close enough vote swing national election. can’t even swing election governor states. new york city didn’t vote george pataki. los angeles didn’t vote pete wilson 1990. 50 biggest city country represent 15 percent population. even fairly big city 350,000 people so, roughly 40 percent vote go republican candidate — case it’s far zero. often rural areas, electoral math holds. and comparison, rural area america also represent 15 percent population, vote 60/40 favor republicans. big city rural america essentially wash every presidential election. idea big city would somehow suddenly decide president everybody else wrong math. sean illing a central focus book idea ending electoral college would change way candidate campaign therefore sort issue prioritize. big deal? jesse wegman it’s great question, think really get heart problem here. candidate visit state even region states, really see warping policy priorities. democratic republican candidate focus issue important to, say, coal miner pennsylvania auto worker michigan, aren’t issue country. campaign forced pay attention everyone country treat every vote equally important, popular vote election would be, would solve problem would fair country whole. issue like immigration reform, health care reform, background check gun — thing vast majority country supports, it’s hard get presidential candidate really get behind aren’t key issue voter battleground states. sean illing the common defense electoral college it’s kind lastresort firewall manifestly unfit president. now, obviously, current president prof useless firewall is, case, principle least, keeping electoral college grounds? jesse wegman no, it’s terrible reason. explained why: donald trump. ever candidate stopped think electoral college designed do, donald trump 2016. reverse happened. reality electoral college never really worked firewall unfit candidate it’s fundamentally partisan institution. 2016 election ought put end argument forever. sean illing there’s least one way effectively end electoral college without technically abolishing it. explain is? jesse wegman it’s called national popular vote interstate compact, it’s quite simple way using electoral college framer designed mean popular vote. it’s endrun around college, people like call it. draw constitution, give state almost total authority award elector however want. idea state join agree award elector whichever candidate win vote nation, state, state now. it’s elegant clever solution problem. sean illing do think reach breaking point status quo loses legitimacy we’re confronted genuine political crisis?

why iowa caucus matter? everyone think do.,2016-01-25,"donald trump dominated gop presidential race seven months. nothing — many offensive comments, mediocre debate performances, oncefeared gop establishment — able stop rise. but february 1, could change trump face far biggest challenge yet: iowa caucuses. the result iowa — first time state actual voter weigh in presidential nomination contest — make national contest turn dime. barack obama iowa 2008, suddenly shot become competitive hillary clinton national polls. john kerry came nowhere win iowa 2004, presumed leader, howard dean, collapsed astonishing speed. and trump could vulnerable iowa. taken lead recent polls, anecdotal report suggesting trump ground game — crucial lowturnout caucus — laughably inferior ted cruzs. first contest really counts, trump could end loser. yet manages pull win — watch out. but let step back minute, ask: quirky iowa caucus tremendous impact race, anyway? what difference first place third place iowa going be, 4,000 votes? like student body election. the state small. population overwhelmingly white. turnout caucus absurdly low. democrat dont even get secret ballot. vanishingly delegate actually determine party nominee national convention iowa. care much wins? a ill explain, iowa became super important — media, party insiders, activists, candidate themselves, even voter extent — gradually decided make important. key player think caucus result reveal great deal candidate win election elsewhere, contest iowa isnt really contest delegate — contest look good eyes. but iowa prominence make sense? could obsession result medium insider alike tremendous overreaction, bordering bizarre mass delusion — one could end distorting get nominated president? what difference first place third place iowa going be, 4,000 votes? like student body election, say stuart stevens, mitt romneys chief strategist 2012. you respect absurdity it, continues. itll drive crazy. 1) iowa caucuses? the iowa caucus first time actual voter across u state get go say want president. and voter literally get go — inperson event, held specific time evening, one 1,681 precinct across state. there absentee voting, youre bedridden state, youve historically luck. (however, year, first time, party letting outofstate member military participate web, democrat making allowance iowan might trouble showing up.) the caucus administered separately major party, republican democrat quite different rules. year, gop contest simple: opening rigmarole caucus sites, ordinary secret ballot vote presidential candidate conducted, total tallied statewide. it kind like carnival, candidate supporter say, come us! the democratic caucus far complicated — theyre rowdy, hourslong public affairs, backandforth debate among attendee go physically stand supporter preferred candidate. kind like carnival, candidate supporter say, come us, group! say drake university political scientist dennis goldford. there secret ballot, democratic candidate doesnt get enough supporter precinct (15 percent attendees), eliminated, reality show style. here video showing one precinct caucus went 2008: 2) care win iowa caucuses? like not, iowa result appear hugely important determining major parties’ presidential nominee — particularly considered alongside impact fellow early state new hampshire. it’s remotely national primary. national poll mean nothing. nation isnt voting, say stevens. instead, iowan get first say. every winner competitive major party presidential nomination contest since 1980 except one started winning iowa caucuses, new hampshire primary, both. both recent president — barack obama george w. bush — kicked primary season winning iowa (and survived subsequent loss new hampshire). and, importantly, even iowa victor doesn’t end winning nomination end, state’s result dramatically shake presidential contest — knocking candidate race entirely, elevating others toptier status eye political elite future voters. you think number people participate — usually little 100,000 people per party, meaning around 20 percent eligible caucusgoers — iowa amazing, outsize impact country, say democratic pollster stan greenberg. 3) why, exactly, smalltime contest affect larger race much? like i, political world obsessed question actually win presidential nomination race. large part world come believe caucus outcome help shed important light question. (remember, iowa, assessment win mainly based poll — polls, course, wrong.) iowa amazing, outsize impact country it pretty weird: essentially, iowa caucus important media, candidates, political world broadly treat result greatly important determining win. play several interacting ways: the medium hype iowa results, branding candidate winner loser based performed there. winner get ton excited coverage, loser become afterthoughts. and, particularly multicandidate fields, winning medium coverage hugely important. donor activists, too, look iowa result judge whether candidate they’re supporting still viable. poor iowa performance likely mean fewer campaign donation endorsements, make difficult candidate stay race. voter state — especially trying make sense complex, multicandidate field — take iowa result (and medium coverage results) cue contender actually win. there’s better evidence win won, say longtime democratic pollster mark mellman. accordingly, poll result state change incredibly quickly iowa result sink in. caucus, across country people paying attention margins, say john norris, who organized several democratic candidates. candidate naturally take account, many invest huge amount time money try well iowa. result come in, candidate poorly often take hint quit race (spurred donor longer fund campaigns, medium outlet longer cover them, subsequent poll showing they’re performing poorly elsewhere). shrinking field process known winnowing. amplify other: behavior candidate assures medium caucus result really important, justifies even coverage iowa. it’s symbiotic relationship, say goldford. long candidate think caucus important, press think caucus important. vice versa. all dynamics, noted, also apply new hampshire (and, decreasing degree, state process continues). media, candidates, political elites, certain extent voter elsewhere act signal believe iowa new hampshire sending them. thats early state contest dramatically reshape nomination landscape long vast majority american people get weigh in. 4) thats pretty abstract. could give example iowa shaken past contests? the earliest case iowa changed everything littleknown former georgia gov. jimmy carter victory 1976 democratic caucuses. second time iowa went first, carter calculated there, hed get much medium coverage hed catapulted obscurity national fame. essentially camped iowa year, strategy worked like charm won. carter subsequent mediadriven poll surge helped narrowly carry new hampshire 11 next 12 contests, followed nomination white house. jimmy carter would say would never become president without iowa caucuses, say jerry crawford, longtime iowa democratic organizer working clinton campaign. iowa convinced people obama medium phenomenon barack obama, too, relied iowa first victory campaign hillary clinton 2008. day caucuses, trailed hillary clinton 20 point national polls. day there, shot within 5 point her. the result iowa validating us, say larry grisolano, consulted obamas campaign year. people became convinced obama medium phenomenon — candidate could attract votes. obamas win made surge within striking distance clinton national polls, far another important early contest, south carolina. iowa peculiarity played strengths, grisolano adds. don’t know would’ve turned started place advertisingcentric. even iowa winner doesnt end winning nomination (as mike huckabee rick santorum, two recent gop winners), caucus result shake race elevating them, rather candidates, prominence contest. the caucus exceeds expectation fails to. set expectations? do. but important understand every candidate affected equally caucuses. iowa matter primarily change perception political world. candidate are, large part, judged whether caucus performance meet expectation medium political elites. for instance, 2008 gop caucuses, mitt romney came second john mccain came fourth. yet romney portrayed big loser, since campaigning hard iowa seemed favorite win. mccain, meanwhile, hadnt really trying win iowa focusing instead well new hampshire, fourthplace finish wasnt interpreted stunning setback him. every candidate iowa opponent, opponent’s name expected, say goldford. caucus exceeds expectation fails to. set expectations? do. 5) bizarre way pick president. iowa granted much power? essentially, iowa moved caucus front line perfect moment. happened back 1972, democratic party overhauling nomination process give actual voters, party bosses, say. thats presidential nomination system know today — monthslong sequence staggered primary caucus every state territory — came about. (republicans adopted similar reform soon afterward.) but 1972 — first nomination contest reformed system — iowa democrat slated usual caucus unusually early date january 24. people offer various different explanation so: deliberate effort help favorite son considering running president, arcane party rule change required 30 day pas various state local events, even lack available hotel room de moines summer necessitated earlier state convention date (which necessitated earlier caucus date). whatever reason, iowa democratic caucus moved ahead new hampshire primary, traditionally nation first. people political community concluded, happened told u something at first, people outside iowa noticed cared, 1972 caucus result got little attention nationally. retrospect, george mcgovern shockingly democratic nomination, insider secondguessing failed predict rise concluded paid attention finished surprisingly strong second iowa. people political community concluded, happened told u something. told u weak frontrunner. told u energy antiwar movement, say david yepsen, former political reporter de moines register. savvy iowan party worked hard promote idea iowa early bellwether. democrat arranged event topline result could easily reported national press, republican moved caucus day create unified event would get lot medium buzz. tom whitney, state democratic chair, later told iowa public television: basically ‘74 elections, organized very, significant kind effort convince first candidate ought iowa national press going here, convince national press iowa candidate going here. so carter victory iowa general election werent great — ended great iowa, could claim kingmaker. future candidate party spent time money there, national press started regularly covering result major event. party insider voter early state began taking iowa result seriously, too. ever since, state party tenaciously successfully fought keep caucus first, helped new precedent set, brookings fellow elaine kamarck chronicle book primary politics. 6) everyone okay giving iowa much say? not all! many critics, including vox dylan matthews, argue iowa population unrepresentative country whole — state much white rural, fewer foreignborn people. others criticize caucus setup itself: event take long time, theyre scheduled specific time evening, there absentee voting past, depresses turnout could make even unrepresentative. (four five registered party member iowa vast majority independent voter usually dont show up.) i think [iowa] distorts process good way, say operative state furthermore, democrat dont even get secret ballot, mean social pressure could skew results. gop side, turnout recently dominated evangelical activists, many opted candidate lack national appeal, like huckabee santorum. and presidential candidate party long felt compelled voice fealty powerful interest group state, like big corn (though peverill squire convincingly argues procorn policy mainly driven congress, white house). finally, seems plain unfair lot people state iowa get power. caucus defender respond saying iowa skew result — positively. think distorts process good way, say crawford, hillary clinton organizer. thats iowa state retail campaigning oneonone interaction voters, rather simply big money ad buys, matter. voter shown dont follow prevailing national wind — theyre willing give littleknown poorly funded challenger chance, help ensure democratic contest overall. iowa level playing ground, say iowa gop operative eric woolson. iowa electorate pay attention whats going on. in case, every attempt supplant iowa failed, neither national party agree else first line, alternative way thing entirely. state tried jump line — like louisiana 1996 — contest boycotted (at iowa pol behest) deemed meaningless national elite press. eventually, national party accepted iowa new hampshire hellbent going first second — vast majority state didnt care much. party began harshly penalizing state tried move nomination contest early. accordingly, nobody even bothered try leapfrog iowa time around. 7) okay, stuck iowa going first now. tell itll affect year race. once again, lesson political world take away caucus really important — delegate end allotted. everyone anxious see actual iowa result measure expectations, help better understand actually win. theyll looking major things. in gop contest, everyone anxiously awaiting answer one key question: donald trump get people actually vote him? despite trump monthslong lead national polls, there still great deal skepticism elite him: perhaps poll overstate support, perhaps campaign doesnt good ground game, perhaps supporter arent regular gop primary caucus voter wont bother show up, perhaps electorate flock seemingly electable candidate last minute. if trump win iowa, prepare medium frenzy like youve never seen before since caucus turnout difficult pollster model since ted cruz perceived better organization trump, much political world long expected trump finish second, behind cruz. yet trump taken lead recent poll — perverse effect raising expectation him. now, second place finish would viewed disappointment him. come third worse, hell portrayed loser went pathetic defeat. manage actually win caucuses, hell debunk much skepticism mentioned above, prove wont vanishing contest anytime soon — unleash medium frenzy like youve never seen before. the iowa result big implication gop candidate too. since ted cruz led poll recently, loss would perceived serious blow candidacy. marco rubio, meanwhile, currently polling third place, thats people expect end up. rubio manages surprise people placing second even first, hell get huge amount positive buzz going new hampshire. somehow fall behind — especially another establishmentfriendly candidate like jeb bush chris christie pass — whispered doubt campaign competence vindicated, whoever beat momentum medium coverage buzz among elite week granite state contest. candidate entirely manages surge late iowa (as rick santorum 2012), expect major player next contests, too. meanwhile, democratic side, bernie sander suddenly surged iowa poll full year trailing clinton. since he long ahead new hampshire, he positioned seriously compete early states. come raised expectations. clinton win contest outright, sander movement could well fizzle out, could wrap nomination quickly. sander win either, though, even come close iowa, expect pitched battle two last quite time. (and unless martin omalley vastly exceeds current low singledigit percent support iowa, expect drop soon afterward.) the nightmare scenario clinton point — implausible — sander win iowa new hampshire. happens, political elite press mercilessly mock secondguess clinton campaign weeks. yet insider also understand state heavily white representative diverse democratic electorate overall. big question whether positive coverage sander get improve performance among nonwhite democrat seemed uninterested candidacy far — put test next contest, south carolina. it goofy way it, agree. absent clear alternative... if feel like needed decoder ring make sense that, youre alone. one sat designed bizarre presidential nomination system — indeed, even iowan admit one would ever sit design exact system scratch. goofy way it, agree, say yepsen. absent clear alternative process continues. candidate keep investing time money, medium keep giving saturation coverage results, political elite keep believing iowa matter — iowa keep mattering. this article originally published january 25, 2016. updated latest expectation candidate perform caucuses.",0,left,Vox,2016
